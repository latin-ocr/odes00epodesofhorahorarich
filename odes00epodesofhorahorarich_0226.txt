178: THE onEs OF HORACE.

ODE XV.

ΟΝ THE IMMODERATE LUXURY OF THE AGE.

This ode is generally considered to be among those
written to assist Augustus in his social reforms, and, as

· Macleane observes, it should be read in connection with

the earlier odes of Book III. Dillenburger assigns the date
to A.U.C. 726, in which year Octavius, then Censor, restored
and adorned the public temples fallen into decay. Mac-

leane

Lo, those regal piles rising 1 methinks, to the harrow ·
They will leave but few acres 3 on every side round us
Vasty stewponds sor fishes extend
Wider bounds than the Lake of Lucrinus.

Yield the vine-wedded elms to that Caelebs the plane-tree 3
And, where olives sufficed for the wealth of the master,
The violet and myrtle encamp,
With the whole languid army of odours 3

Every sunstroke shut out by thick screen-works of laurel.
Ah Ξ not such the decrees left by Rome's hardy Founder,
Nor the auspice of Cato unshorn‚
Nor the customs bequeathed by our fathers.

Petty then was to each man the selfish possession,
Mighty then was all to men the Commonwealth's treasure 3
No one sought the cool shade of the North
Under peristyles planned out for temples 3⁹⁶

The chance turf next at hand roofed the citizen's dwelling‚
But the State, at its charge, rarest marble devoted
To the State's sacred heirlooms 5———the shrines
Of the godS‚ and the courts of a people.
