Philippi turned Augustus’s flank, stormed his camp, and
nearly took him prisoner. · Subsequently he made terms
with Antony, whom he left for Augustus, after Antony’s
league with Cleopatra—and at Actium commanded the
centre of the fleet with great distinction. Besides his
eminence as a commander and a statesman, he was con-
spicuous as an orator, a wit, a historian, and a grammarian.
He also wrote poetry.—-See Smith's Dictionary for fuller
details of his life, art. “ Messala.’'

CARM. XXI.

O nata mecum consule Manlio,

Seu tu querelas, sive geris jocos

Seu rixam et insanos amoreS,
Seu facilem, pia testaff‘ somnum,

Quocunque lectum nomine† Massicum
Servas, moveri digna bono die,
Descende,‡ Corvino jubente
Promere languidiora vina.

Non ille, quamquam Socraticis madet
Sermonibus, te negleget horridus :
Narratur et prisci Catonis
Saepe mero§ caluisse virtus.

Tu lene tormentum ingenio admoves
Plerumque duro ; tu sapientium

† “ Quocunque nomine,'’ “ on whatever account‚’' On the technical
meaning of “nomen‚” signifying “an entry in an account‚'' see Mr
Long‘s note on Cicero in Verr. 11, 1, 38. “ ‘Lectum‚’ which For-
cellini interprets ‘ selected‚' rather applies to the gathering of the grape
from which the wine was made. Massic wine was from Mons Massicus
in Campania.'’-MACLEANE.

ss “ Descend ”—z'. e., descend from the place where it was kept (apo-
theca), in the upper part of the house.
