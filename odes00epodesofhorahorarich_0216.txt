168 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Say, for all that Achaemenes boasted of treasure‚

All the wealth which Myg'donia gave Phrygia in tribute,

All the stores of all Araby-say‚ wouldst thou barter
One lock of Licymnia's bright hair ?—

When at moments she bends down her neck to thy kisses,

Or declines them with coy but not crue] denial3

Rather pleased if the prize be snatched off by the spoiler,
Nor slow in reprisal sometimes.
