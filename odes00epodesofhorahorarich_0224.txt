176 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Lands, home, and wife, in whom thy soul delighteth‚
L‘eft3 and one tree alone of all thy woodlandS‚
Loathed cypress, faithful found,
Shall follow to the last the brief-lived lord.

The worthier heir thy Caecuban shall squander,
Bursting the hundred locks that guard its treasure‚
And wines more rare than those
Sipped at high feast by pontiffs,⁹⁶ dye thy floors.

⁴* As the English say, “A dinner fit for an alderman,'' so the Romans
said, “ A banquet fit for a pontiff.'' ‘⁴ Pontificum dapes, Saliares
coenae.'’
