164 , THE onEs OF HORACE.

ODE XI.

TO QUINTIUS HIRPINUS.

Who this Hirpinus was we do not know. Orelli con-
siders it probable that he is the Quintius to whom Ep.
Ι. xvi. is addressed. But Macleane observes “that the
latter appears to have been younger than the former, whom
Horace addresses (v. 15) as if he were a contemporary.'’
But the question is immaterial 3 for we'know no more about
the Quintius of the Epistle than the Hirpinus of the Ode.

What the warlike Cantabrian or Scythian,
From ourselves by an ocean disparted,
Take it into their heads to devise,
Do not class with the questions that press.

Be not over-much anxious, Hirpinus,
For the things of a life that needs little 3
See how Beauty recedes from our side
With her beardless9⁶ twin playfellow Youth.

Grizzled Age, dry and sapless, comes chasing
Frolic Loves and the balm of light Slumbers3
Not the· same glory lasts to the flower,
Not the same glowing face to the moon z

Why to fathom the counsels eternal
Strain the Mind without strength for such labour?
Why not rather, yon plane-trec beneath,
Or this pine, fling us carelessly down,

While we may 3 letting locks whiten under
Syrian nard and the fragrance of roses.
Drink 1 Evius dispels eatingcares.
Ho l which of you, boys, will assuage

This Falernian in yon running waters ?
Which entice that sequestered jade, Lyde,†
With her iv'ry lute, and with her locks,
Like a Spartan maid'S, simply knit back.
