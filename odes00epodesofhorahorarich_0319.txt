CARM. XIV.

Herculis ritu modo dictus, O Plebs,

Morte venalem petiisse laurum,

Caesar Hispana repetit Penates
Victor ab ora.

Unico gaudens mulier marito*

Prodeat, justis operata sacris 3

Et soror clari ducis, et decorae
Supplice vitta

Virginum matres, juvenumque nuper†

Sospitum. Vos, O pueri et puellae

Jam virum expertae, male ominatis
Parcite verbis.

Hic dies vere mihi festus atras

Eximet curas 3 ego nec tumultum,

N ec mori per vim metuam,‡ tenente
Caesare terraS.

Ι, pete unguentum, puer, et coronas,

Et cadum Marsi memorem duelli,

Spartacum§ si qua potuit vagantem
Fallere testa.

and the Servile war, headed by Spartacus, lasted from A.U.C. 681 to 683 3
therefore the wine Horace wanted would have been sixty-five years old
at least. There seems to have been something remarkable in the vin-

tage of that period, so as to make it proverbial; for Juvenal, one hun-
dred years afterwards, speaking of the selfish gentleman who keeps his
best wine for his own drinking, says :—

‘ Ipse capillato diffusum consule potat,

Calcatamque tenet bellis socialibus uvam. ' '’
