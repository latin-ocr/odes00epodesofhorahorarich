the commentators have, however, doubted whether Horace
could have ventured to speak so freer, as in the concluding
lines, of av Roman matron of rank so illustrious as Terentia,
and would therefore assume Licymnia to have been rather
the mistress than the wife of Maecenas. This supposition
is incompatible with the description of Licymnia Joining in
the festivals of Diana 3 and probably Horace sufficiently
preserved such respect to the wife of his patron as the
manners of the time required by substituting a feigned
name for her own.

CARM. XII.

Nolis longa ferae bella Numantiae,

Nec dirum Hannibalern, nec Siculum mare

Poeno' purpureum sanguine, mollibus
Aptari citharae modis,

Nec saevos Lapithas, et nimium mero
Hylaeum, domitosque Herculea manu
Telluris juvenes, unde periculum

F ulgens contremuit domus

Saturni veteris; tuque pedestribus

Dices historiis proelia Caesaris,

Maecenas, melius ductaque per vias
Regum colla minacium.

Me dulces dominae Musa Licymniae

Cantus, me voluit dicere lucidum

Fulgentes oculos et bene mutuis
Fidum pectus amoribus ;

Quam nec ferre pedem dedecuit choris,

Nec certare joco, nec dare brachia ¹

Ludentem nitidis virginibus, sacro
Dianae celebris die.
