BooK 1.--oDE xxvnr. 93

ral, if recent, assent with scholars than any other hypothesis
—and, after much consideration, Ι have adopted it in my
version. If the poem is, however, to be considered a dia-
logue, 1 should not agree with Macleane in placing the
division at verse Ι5Ῐ6 but at verse 20—“ Me quoque
devexi,’' διο. The very abruptness of the interposition of
the ghost at that line, which has been considered by many
critics objectionably harsh, appears to me a special merit.
The ghost, commencing his appeal at that verse, goes at
once to the purpose. He, being dead, has no need to say
that all must die3 but, contenting himself with briefly
informing the voyager that he has been drowned, hastens
to implore the handfuls of dust which suffice for burial.
That it is not Archytas himself who speaks, whether in
monologue or dialogue, is, I think, made perfectly apparent
by the second and third verses of the ode—-

‘⁴ Mensorem cohibent, Archyta,
Pulveris exigui prope litus parva Matinum
Munera,''

which Ι agree with Macleane in considering clearly to
intimate that the body of Archytas has already received that
which he is supposed so earnestly to pray for. “ For,'' thus
continues this judicious scholar, “though many, Ι am aware,
get over this difficulty by supposing ‘cohibent munera ' to

⁴* Ι believe that most critics are now agreed that if the poem be a
dialogue the first speaker cannot be interrupted at verse 6, or before

verse 15. The lines 14, 15-—

“Judice te non sordidus auctor
Naturae verique‚”

seem to settle that question. Archytas, if commencing at line 16,
could scarcely appeal to the sailor as a judge of the learning of Pytha-
goras, while the first speaker would very appropriately say that Archy-
tas was a judge of it. The attempt to get over this difficulty by corrupt·
ing a text sanctioned by all the MSS„ and substituting “ me judice ’²
for “te judice,” is nowadays rejected by rational commentators, who
’ rightly oppose unauthorised amendments of texts supported by the con·

currence of MSS.
