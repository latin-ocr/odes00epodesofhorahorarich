202 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Man vies withv man—’tis so ordained3 this, wider sets his
vineS‚⁹⁵
That‚ nomer-born, the Campus† seekS, competitor for power
With one who boasts of purer life,
And one of clients more :

N ecessity with equal law assorts the varying lots 3
Though this may bear the lofty name and that may bear the

low,
Each in her ample urn she shakes,
And casts the die for all.‡

To him above whose guilty neck hangs down the naked

sword,
Sicilian arts elaborate not the sweets that flavour food,

Nor song of bird nor chord of lute
Charms back the truant sleep.§

Yet sleep is meek, nor scorns the cots that shelter rural ton,
Nor banks that find their pall of state in shadowy summer
boughs‚
Nor vales in Temp'e never vexed
Save by the Zephyr's wing.

* “ Est ut viro vir latius ordinet
Arbusta sulcis.'’
“ Est ut,’' “it is the case, it is ordained that men should vary in wealth
and condition.’'—YONGE. “Latius ordinet arbusta sulcis ''—·viZ.‚ one
'man may compete with another man in extent of possessions ε literally,
that he may marshal trees—chiefly, but not exclusively‚ vines—in par·
allel lines, or in the shape of the quincunX, to a greater extent than

another.
ἢ· “ Descendat in Campum.” It was on the Campus Martius that the

Comitia Centuriata, at which the election of magistrates took place, were
held. The Campus was on low ground ; but Yonge observes that
“ descendat ” is the exact word to express a contest, to descend into the

arena.
