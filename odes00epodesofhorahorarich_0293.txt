’ CARM. VII.

Quid fles, Asterie, quem tibi candidi
Primo restituent vere Favonii

Constantis juvenem fide,

Post insana Caprae sidera, frigidas
Noctes non sine multis
Insomnis lacrimis agit.

Atqui sollicitae nuntius hospitae,
Suspirare Chloen, et miseram tuis
Dicens ignibus uri,
Tentat mille vafer modis.

Peleus, overcome with satigue, fell asleep on the mountain, Acastor con-
cealed his sword, and left him alone and unarmed to be devoured by the
beasts. Peleus on waking and searching for his sword was attacked by
Centaurs, but saved by Chiron.
