334 THE ODES OF HORACE.

as Horace's should have refrained from all mention of one to
whom he was under no mean obligations for the popularity
his verses had acquired, and with whom he must have been
necessarily brought into frequent and familiar intercourse.
It may, however, be said, as sufficient reason for such silence
in either case, that a Roman of Horace’s day would not
have held the art of a musical composer in high account.
The writers who have sought to elucidate the obscure
subject of ancient music consider it probable that nothing
like the modern system of musical rhythm existed among
the ancients‚ and that, since there is no mention of notatim
distinct from the metre of the song, the time was marked
by that metre where vocal music was united with instru-
mental (Burney's ‘History of Music 3' Hawkins's ‘Hist. of
Music 3' Smith's Dict., art. “ Musica ’'). By this the reader
can judge for himself whether Horace’s task in timing the
music to his own rhythms would not have been compara—
tively easy 3 and whether, if it were thus easy, it would hav-e
been considered worthy of commemoration by his con·
temporarieS, or been preserved in such brief records of his
life as were consulted by Suetonius, or known to the
scholiasts.
At all events, Horace appears, on the occasion of the
Secular Hymn, to have superintended the rehearsal of the
reeltative

O Phoebus, and O forest-queen Diana,

Ye the twin lustrous ornament of heaven,

Though ever holy, in this time most hallowed
Be most benign to prayer 1

For duly now, as Sibyl verse enjoins us,

Pure youths, with chosen virgins linked in chorus,

To Powers divine o'er the Seven Hills presiding,
Uplift the solemn hymn.
