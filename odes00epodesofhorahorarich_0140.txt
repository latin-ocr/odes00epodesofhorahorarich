92 THE ODES OF HORACE.

O D E X X V I I I.
ARCHYTAS.

No ode in Horace has been more subjected than this one
to the erudite ingenuity of conflicting commentators3 nor
are the questions at issue ever likely to find a solution in
which all critics will be contented to agree.

The earlier commentators took for granted that the ode
was composed as a dialogue between the ghost of Archytas
and a voyager. The voyager, landing on the shore of Ma-
tinus, finds there the unburied bones of Archytas, and in-
dulges in a sarcastic soliloquy, which ends either at verse 6,
verse 16, verse 20, or, as Macleane was once of opinion, in
the middle of verse 15—-

“ Sed omnes una manet nox‚''

Two other theories have been started, by both of which
Archytas is got rid of altogether. According to the first
theory, the moralising voyager continues his reflections over
the grave of the great geometrician, till (whether at verse
15, 16, or 20) the ghost, not of Archytas, but of another,
whose bones are bleaching on the sand, rises up, accosts
him, and prays to be sprinkled with the dust that may serve
for burial and fit him for the Styx.

The second theory, favoured by Macleane, and supported
by Mr Long, dispenses not only with Archytas, but with the
notion of dialogue. According to this conjecture, the whole
poem is assigned to the ghost of a shipwrecked and unburied
man, who moralises over Archytas and the certainty of death,
&C., till, seeing a living sailor approach, he asks for> burial.
This supposition, the simplest in itself, and sanctioned by
great critical authoritieS, appears to be gaining a more gene-
