after his time gave the name of Odes, and on which his
eminence as a poet must mainly rely. Whatever merit be
ascribed to his Satires, it is scarcely in the power of genius
to raise satire to an elevated rank in poetry. Satire, indeed,
is the antipodes of poetry in its essence and its mission.
Satire always tends to dwarf, and it cannot fail to caricature ;
but poetry does nothing if it does not tend to enlarge and
exalt, and if it does not seek rather to beautify than deform.
And though such didactic and moralising vein as belongs to
the Epistles of Horace be in itself much higher than satire,
and in him has graces of style that,¹with his usual consum-
mate taste, he rejects for satire, which he regards but as a
rhythmical prose, still, the higher atmosphere in which the
genius of lyrical song buoys and disports itself is not within
the scope of that didactic form of poetry which “walks
highest but not flies.'' Hegel, in his luminous classification
of the various kinds of poetry, has perhaps somewhat too
sharply drawn the line between its several degrees of rank 3
yet every one acquainted with the rudimentary principles of
criticism must acknowledge‚ that just as it requires a larger
combination of very rare gifts to write an epic or a drama
which the judgment of ages allows to be really great, than
to write a lyrical poem, so it demands a much finer combi-
. nation of some of the rarest of those rare gifts to write a
lyrical poem whichf becomes the song of all times and
nations‚ than to write a brilliant sarcasm upon human infir-
mitieS, or an elegant lecture in the style of an Epistle.
These last require but talents, however great, which are
more or less within the province of prose-writers. The
novel of ‘Gil Blas' or the Essays of Montaigne evince
qualities of genius equal at least to those displayed in
Horace's Satires and Epistles. But if you were to multi-
ply Lesages and Montaignes ad infinitum, they could not
accomplish a single one of Horace's nobler odes.

Now, the first thing that strikes us in examining the
