BOOK 111.—0DE V. 231

and accepted military service under the conqueror 3 and
in thus energetically representing the moral disgrace of
these men, Horace is very evidently opposing some propo-
sition then afloat for demanding their restoration from the
Parthians. Such demand, which would no doubt be urged
by the relatives of the “de'tenus‚ and perhaps by many old
fellow-soldiers in the Roman army, might easily have ac-
quired the importance of what we call a party question.
And if Horace here opposes it, it is pretty certain that
Augustus opposed it also at that time. Hence the ode
would have been written before Augustus redemanded (A. U. C.
731) the Roman captives and standards from Phraates.
And the date A.U.C. 728 or 729, assigned to the ode by
Orelli, is probably the true one. A demand which circum-
stances rendered reasonable and politic in 731, might have
been very inopportune and unwise two or three years be-
fore. In aiming at his political object, Horace skilfully eludes
its exact definition. He begins by saying, that as it is by
his thunder we believe in Jove, so the power of Augustus
will be recognised when he shall have added the Britons
and Parthians to his empire. Thus, agreeably with> the
oratorical character of his poetry, on which I have ob-
served in the preliminary essay, his exordium propitiates
the ear of the party he is about to oppose—viz., those
clamorous for the restoration of the Parthian. prisoners.
He follows this exordium with a rapid outburst on the
ignominy of these very prisoners, and then, with admirable
boldness, places the argument against their restoration in
the mouth of the national hero Regulus. It is in these and
similar passages that Horace not only soars immeasurably
above the level of didactic poetry properly so called, but
justifies his claim to a far higher rank even in lyrical poetry
than many of his modern critics are disposed to accord to
him. He attains to that region of the sublime which be-
longs to heroic sentiment, and which is the rarest variety of
the sublime even in the tragic drama.
