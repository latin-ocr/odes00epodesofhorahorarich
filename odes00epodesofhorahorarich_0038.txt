xxxiv THE oDEs OF HORACE,

quoted, the most remembered. The reason, perhaps, is, that
most men have loved up to the extent that Horace admits
the passion, and very few men have loved much beyond
that limit.

N otwithstanding the amazing pains taken by grave pro-
fessors and erudite divines to ascertain the history of Horace’s
love-affairs—to'tell us who and what those young beauties
were—whom he loved first and whom he loved last—how
many of them are to be reduced to a select few, one being
sung under different names lending their syllables to the

are one and the same person, &c—the question remains in-
soluble. Some scholars have had even the cold-blooded
audacity to assert that, with the single exception of Cinara,
and some strange sort of entanglement with the terrible
sorceress to whom he gives the name of Canidia, all these
Horatian beauties are myths and figments—as purely dreams
as those out of the ivory gater—many of them, no doubt,
translations, more or less free, from the Greek.

The safest conjecture here, as in most cases of disputed
judgment, lies between extremes

It is probable enough that a man like Horace—a man of
wit and pleasure—thrown early into gay society, and of a
very affectionate nature, as is evinced by the warmth of his
friendships--should have been pretty often in what is com-
monly called “ love '' during, say, thirty-nine years out of the
fifty-seven in which he led a bachelor’s life. And as few
poets ever have been more subjective than Horace—ever
received the aspect of life more decidedly through the
medium of their own personal impressions.—-or more re-
garded poetry as the vehicle of utterance for their opinions
and doctrines, their likings and dislikings, their joys and their
sorrows—so it may be reasonably presumed that in many of
his love-verses he expresses or symbolises his own genuine
state of feeling. Nor if in some of these there be detected
