INTRODUCTION. XXV

So again, when his lady friend, Galatea, is about to
undertake a voyage, he begins by a playful irony about
omens, hastens to the reality of stormy seas—and suddenly
we have the picture of Europa borne from the field-flowers
to the midst οξ the ocean. We behold her forlorn and
alone on the shores of Crete—hearken to the burst of her
despair and replentance-and see the drama conclude with
the consolatory appearance of Venus, and Cupid with his
loosened bow.g To some commentators these vivid pre-
sentations of ‘dramatic imagery have appeared exotic to
the poem—-episodes and interludes. But the more they
are examined as illustrange’s-QQ
lyric art, the more (in this respect not unimitative of Pindar)
they stand out as the body of his piece, and the developed
completion of his purpose. Take them away, and the
poems themselves would shrink into elegant vers d'occasion.
Horace, in a word, generally studies to secure to each of his
finer and more careful poems, however brief it be, that
which play-writers call “a backbone.’' And even where he
does not obtain this through direct and elaborate picture
or dramatic effect and interest, he achieves it perhaps in
a single stanza, embodying some striking truth or maxim of
popular application, &xpressed with a terseness so happy,
that all times and all nations adopt it as a proverb.

. We see, then, how'much of his art in construction de-
pends on his lavish employ of picture and drama—how
much on compression and brevity. We must next notice,
as constituent elements of Horace's peculiar charm, his em-
ployment of playful irony, and the rapidity of Qansitions
from s ortive to earnest, earnest to sportive3 so that, per-
haps, no poe e avails himself of the effect of “surprise ''
—yet the Qus} is not coarse and glaring, but for the
most part singularly subdued and delicate—arising some-

in his lyrics, more of that COQ
