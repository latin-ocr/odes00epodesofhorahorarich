BOOK 1v.—0DE vm. 383

Si chartae sileant, quod bene feceris,
Mercedem tuleris. Quid foret Iliae
Mavortisque puer, si taciturnitas
Obstaret meritis invida Romuli?
Ereptum Stygiis fluctibus AEacum
Virtus et favor et lingua potentium
Vatum divitibus consecrat insulis.⁹⁵
Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori:
Caelo Musa beat. Sic Jovis interest
Optatis epulis impiger Hercules
Clarum Tyndaridae sidus ab infimis
Quassas eripiunt aequoribus rates 3
Ornatus viridi tempora pampino
Liber vota bonos ducit ad exitus.

Ι (10 not admit it in translation, though, like all the suggestions of this
eminent critic, it mex-its respectful attention. I may add that Ritter
also separates ‘⁶ virtus'’ and “favor'’ from “lingua potentium vatum.’'4
