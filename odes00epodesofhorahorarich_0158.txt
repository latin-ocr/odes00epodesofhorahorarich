110 “ ΤΗΕ ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XXXIV.

TO HIMSELF.

In this poem Horace appears to recant the Epicurean
doctrine, which referred to secondary causes, and not to the
providential agency of Divine power, the government of the
universe, and which he professed, Sat. Ι. v, 101, and Epp.
Ι. iv. 16. But, in fact, he candidly acknowledges his own
inconsisteney in all such matters, and is Stoic or Epicurean
by fits and starts. In this ode he evidently connects the
phenornenon of thunder in a serene sky with the sudden re-
volutions of fortune. The concluding verses are generally
held to refer to the Parthian revolution, in which power was
transferred now from Phraates to TiridateS‚ and again
from Tiridates back to Phraates. In the last stanza—

“ Hinc apicem rapax
Fortuna cum stridore acuto
Sustulit, hic posuisse gaudet '’—

it was suggested in the ‘ Cambridge Philological Museum,'
May 1832, that Horace had in his mind the legend of
the eagle taking off the cap of Tarquinius. For the conve-
nience of the general reader the story may be briefiy thus

told.

Forced in the courses left behind to steer:

For not, as wont, disparting serried cloud
With fiery flash‚ but through pure azure, drove
Of late Diespiter
His thundering coursers and his winged car 3
