304 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XXV.
HYMN To BACCHUS.

Of this ode Orelli says, that it belongs more properly than
any other ode of Horace to the dithyrambic genus, any
closer imitation of which was denied to the language and
taste of the Romans, as savouring of affectation or bombast.
N owhere in Horace is there more of the true lyrical enthu-

siasm ε
Whither, full of thee, O Bacchus,

Am I hurried by thy rapture, with a spirit strange possessed?

T hrough what forests, through what caverns?

Underneath what haunted grottoes shall my voice be heard
aloud‚

Pondering words to lift up Caesar
To his rank 'mid starry orders, in the council-halls of Jove?
O for utterance largely sounding,

Never yet through mouth of poet made the language of
the world !

As the slumberless Bacchante

From the lonely mountain-ridges, stricken still with won-
der, sees

Flash the waves of wintry Hebrus,
Sparkle snows in Thracian lowIands, soar barbarian Rho-
dope,

Such my rapture, wandering guideless‚⁹⁵
Now where river-margents open, now where forest-sha-
dows close.

Rz'pas et vacuum nemus
Mirari libet.''
