Scandit aeratas vitiosa naves

Ocior cervis, et agente nimbos

Ocior Euro.

Spiritum Graiae tenuem Camenae

Parca non mendax§ dedit, et malignum

deerees.'’ Compare “ veraees,” C. Saecul. 25, and Persius, v. 42,
“ Parca tenax veri.''—So ORELLI. ‘⁴ Genius is represented as the gift
of Fate in Pind. Od. ix. 26, 28 ; also in Nem. iv. 41—43, where the poet
infers from it his own eventual triumph over detraction ; as Horace may
be said to do here.''—Y0NGE.
