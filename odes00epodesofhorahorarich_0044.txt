xl THE ODEs OF HORACE.

In the Alcaic stanza I have thus employed two different
forms of rhythm 3 the one, which is of more frequent recur-
rence, as in Ode ix.—the other, as in Odes xxxiv.-xxxv.,
Book I. 3 either of which admits of slight occasional variations
without disturbance to the general character or ‘⁴ type '' of
the measure.

avoided, save in one or two o'f‘t‘iie‘s'liss‘r'ter poems, any imita-
tion of the chime rendered sufficiently familiar by Canning’s
“ Knife-grinder,'’ not only because, in the mind of an Eng-
lish reader, it is associated with a popular burlesque, but
chiefly because an English imitation of the Latin rhythm,
witha due observance of the trochee in the first three lines
of the stanza, has in itself an unpleasant and monotonous
sing-song. In my version of the Sapphic Ι have chiefly
employed two varieties of rhythm ε for the statelier odes, our
own recognised blank verse in the first three lines, usually,
though not always, with a dissyllabic termination ,- and, in
the fourth line, a metre analogous in length and cadence to
the fourth line of the original, though, of course, without
any attempt at preserving the Latin quantity of dactyl and
spondee. In fact, as Dr Kennedy has truly observed, the
spondee is not attainable in our language, except by a very
forced effort of pronunciation. That which passes current
as an English spondee is really a trochee. For the lighter
odes of the Sapphic metre, a more sportive or tripping mea-

sure is adopted.
I must leave my versions of the other metres which

Horace has less frequently employed to speak for them-

In the Latin version, placed side by side with the Eng-
lish, I have generally adopted the text of Orelli. The rare
instances in which Ι have differed from it for that of another

editor are stated in the notes, For the current punctuation
