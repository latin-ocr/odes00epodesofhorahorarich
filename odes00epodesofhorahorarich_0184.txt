136 THE ODES OF HORACE.

While thy fortune, and youth,÷÷ and the woof
Of the Three Fatal Sisters allow.

Woodlands dearly amassed† round the home proudly builded,
Stately villa with walls laved by Tiber’s dun waters‚
Thou must quit 3 and the wealth piled on high
Shall become the delight of thine heir.

For no victim has death either preference or pity,
Be thy race from the king who first reigned o'er the Argive,
Or thy father a beggar, thy roof
Yonder sky,—’tis the same to the Grave.

Driven all to that sold ;‡ in one fatal urn shaken‚
Soon or late must leap forth the sure lot for an exile
In the dark passage-boat which comes back
To the sweet native land never more.

⁴* “ AEtas‚'‘ which Acron translates “youth‚” an interpretation ap-
proved by Estre and Macleane. It more accurately‚ however, means “the
time of life,” including every period before that in which old age dead-
ens the sense of such holiday enjoyments. Dellius was not young at the
date of this poem ; but, at years more advanced‚ M. Antony was young
enough to enjoy the present hour rather too much.

together.’'-YONGE.

sheep. ’'—ORELLL
