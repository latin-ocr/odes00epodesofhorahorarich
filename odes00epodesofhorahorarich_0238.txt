THE ODES OF HORACE.

Day treads upon the heels of day,
N ew moons wane on to perish 3
Thou on the brink of death dost make
Vain contracts for new marble 3

Building proud homeS, and of thy last—
The sepulchre—forgetful 3

As if the earth itself too small
Thou robb’st new earth from ocean,

And, urging on a length of shore
Upon the deep’s foundation,

Thou thrustest back the angry wave
That wars in vain on Baiae)⁵

What, must thou also, greeding still,
Remove thy neighbour's landmark—
Must ruthless avariee overleap
Each fence of humble clients?

And man and wailing wife, expelled
The dear paternal dwelling,

Clasp ragged babes and exiled gods
To wandering homeless bosoms?

And yet no surer hall awaits
The wealthy tyrant master,

Than that which yields yet ampler room
In yet more greedy Orcus

Where farther tend? Impartial earth
Opes both for prince and peasant 3

’ No gold bribed Charon to row back

The crafty-souled Prometheus.

Death holds the haughty Tantalus 3
Death holds his children haughty:
Invoked or not, Death hears the poor,

And He gives rest to labour.
