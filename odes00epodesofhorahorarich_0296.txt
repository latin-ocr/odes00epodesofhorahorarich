248 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE VIII.

’ῘῸ MAECENAS, ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ANNIVERSARY OF HORACE'S ESCAPE
FROM THE FALLING TREE.

According to Franke‚ Horace's escape from the tree was
in A.U.c. 728. Ritter places it in 724. This poem com-
memorates the anniversary of that accident.

Learned as thou art in lore of either languages*
Thou marvellest why these hymeneal Kalends

Of March† I keep-——L solitary Caelebs,
Wherefore these flowerets Ρ

This censer full of incense? this heaped fuel
On the live sod? Know that, escaped the death-blow
Of the dire tree, I a white goat to Bacchus

Vowed, and feast-offerings.

The day, thus sacred, with the year returning,

Shall free from cork and all its pitch-sealed fastenings

That jarss which first imbibed the smoke—reek under
Tullus the Consul.

In honour of thy friend thus saved, Maecenas,

Quaff brimming cups—a hundred be the number 3

Let the gay lights watch with us for the morning,
Noise and brawl banished.

Cast off the burden of a statesman's trouble,

Routed are Cotiso's fierce Dacian armies,

Mede wroth with Mede, upon fraternal slaughter,
Wastes his wild fury.§

ᾖ viz„ Greek and Latin, which, as the eommentators observe, com-
prehended all the learning a Roman could well acquire.

† The Matronalia, in honour of Juno Lucina, were held in the March
Kalends.
