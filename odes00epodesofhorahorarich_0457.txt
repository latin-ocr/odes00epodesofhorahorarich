BOOK IV.—0DE XV. 409

wished to sing of those warS, Phoebus checked him. But
Phoebus does not forbid him to sing the triumphs of peace 3
and, with a lively lyrical abruptnes8‚ he therefore at once
bursts forth :—-

“ Tua, Caesar, aetas
Fruges et agris retulit uberes‚’' &a

That the poem was composed immediately after the return
of Caesar, and in connection with Odes iv. and xiv„ is, Ι
think, made clear by its own internal evidence. War is
finished, and Augustus is celebrated as the triumphant
establisher of law and order, and the author of the na-
tional prosperity, and the improvements, social and moral,
which result from the security to life and property bestowed
by a government at once firm and beneficent. He is here
the descendant, not of Mars and Ilia, but of Anchises and
Venus the gentle.

CARM. XV.

Phoebus volentem proelia me loqui
Victas et urbes, increpuit lyra3
Ne parva Tyrrhenum per aequor
Vela darem. Tua, Caesar, aetas

Fruges et agris retulit uberes,
Et signa nostro restituit Jovi,
Derepta Parthorum superbis
Postibus, et· vacuum duellis

Janum Quirini clausit, et ordinem
Rectum evaganti frena Licentiae
Injecit, emovitque culpas,9⁶
Et veteres revocavit arteS‚†
