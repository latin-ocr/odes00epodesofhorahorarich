132 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Virtue‚ dissentient from the vulgar judgment,

Strikes from the list of happy men Phraates,

Even when restored to the great throne of Cyrus 3
Virtue unteaches

Faith in false doctrines mouthed out by the many,

Holding safe only lzis realm, crown, and laurel,

Whose sight nor blinks, nor swerveS‚ though, heaped before it,
Shine the worssd’s treasureS.
