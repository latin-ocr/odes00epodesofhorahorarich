74 THE ODES OF HORA‘CE. ’

,ΟΒΕ Xil

TO MAECENAS.

Nothing can be more simple in form and spirit than this
ode, in which Horace invites Maecenas to a homely enter-
tainment in language equally unostentatious. In this, as in
other of Horace's purely occasional odes, one feels, by the
abstemious avoidance of the would-be poetical, that only a

poet

Thou wilt drink but in modest cups Sabine wine humble

Which Ι with mine own hand in Grecian cask hoarded,

When the theatre hailed thee with plaudits, beloved,
Knightly Maecenas,

So loud, as if fain that the gay phantom Echo

To thine ear from the heights of the Vatican mountain,

To thine ear from the banks of thy river ancestral,
Might reapplaud them.

Thou mayst drink at thy will the rich Caecuban vinta'ge,

Or the milder grapes Cales have tamed in its presses :

Formian slopes, vines Falernian‚ combine not to flavour
My simple wine-cups.
