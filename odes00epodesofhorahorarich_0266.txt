218 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Than in wringing its uses to men,
With a hand that would plunder the gods*

What limit soe’er may obstruet her in nature
Let her reach by her arms 3 bounding blithely to visit†
Either pole, where the mist or the sun
Holds the orgies of water or fire.

I to Rome's warlike race speak such fates, on condition
That they never, too pious to antique forefathers,
Nor confiding too far in their power,
Even wish Trojan roofs to restore.

What though Troy could revive under auspices fatal—
All her fortunes should be repetition of carnage ;
I myself leading hosts to her doom—
Ι the consort and sister of Jove 1

Rose her brazen wall thrice, with Apollo for founder,‡
Still her brazen wall thrice should be razed by my Argives 3
Thrice the captive wife mourn for her lord,
Thrice the mother her children deplore.

Ah, this strain does not chime to my lute's lively measures Ξ
Whither tendest thou, Muse? Cease, presumptuous, to mimic
The discourses of gods 3 nor let down
To ‘a music low-pitched, lofty themes.

* ‘⁶ Quam cogere humanos in usus

Omne sacrum rapiente dextra.''
The point here, as Orelli observes, is in the antithesis between “hu- ,
manos '' and “ sacrum.” Macleane paraphrases the general meaning of
the passage thus,—-“ Let Rome extend her arms as she will, only let
her not, as her possessions increase, learn to prize gold above virtue. '’
The more literal meaning, according to Dillenburger and Orelli, is, that
in the lust of gold the hand of rapine sacrilegiously despoils the sacred
vessels dedicated to gods in their shrines and temples.
