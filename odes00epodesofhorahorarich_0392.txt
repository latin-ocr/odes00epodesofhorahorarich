344 THE ODES OF. HORACE.

Noble and fair is he 3
Nor his the lips to pleading suitors mute 3
Youth of a hundred arts

To bear thy eonquering standards wide and far3
ἱ

Whene'er some rival, rich
In gifts‚ he conquers, laughing‚ he shall placen
By Alban waters, under citron roofS, ¹
Imaged in marble‚ Thee.

There shalt thou take delight

In spiced balms‚ and songs commingled sweet
With Berecynthiam fise

And lyre—-nor silent ὒὲτὴε fluten re'ed.

There, twice a-day‚ shall youths
Choral with tender maidens, chant thy name,
, As thriee‚ in Salian dance,

Quakes the green sod to feet that twinkle white.

But me nor youth nor maid
Allures, nor saith in intermingled souls,
Nor to contend in wine3
No verna] flowerets wreathe my temples now.
