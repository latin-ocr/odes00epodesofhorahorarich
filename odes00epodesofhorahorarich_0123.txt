BoOK L—ODE xx. 7 5

poet could have written it. The date of the poem has been
variously conjectured. Judging by the reference to the
Sabine wine which Maecenas is invited to drink, and which
came into use in its second year, reaching its prime in
its fourth, the poem would have been written between two
, and four years after the reception that the audience at the
theatre gave to Maecenas on his recovery from his illness.
But the date of that event ,is not determined. Franke and
Liibker refer the composition of the ode to A.U.C. 729-7 30.
Macleane favours the latter year. Orelli inclines to Weber's
date, from A.u.c. 726-727.

CARM. XX.

Vile potabis modicis Sabinum
Cantharis, Graeca quod ego ipse testa
Conditum levi, datus in theatro

Cum tibi plausuS,

Care Maecenas eques, ut paterni

Fluminis ripae, simul et jocosa‘

Redderet laudes tibi Vaticani¹
Montis imago.

Caecubum et prelo domitam Caleno

Tu bibes uvam : mea nec-Falernae

Temperant vites, neque Formiani
Pocula colles,
