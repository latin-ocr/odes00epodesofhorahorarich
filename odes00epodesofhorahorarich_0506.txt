“458 THE EPoDE's‘ oF ; HORACE.

EPODE XIII..
TO FRIENDg.

Of all the EpodeS, this, of which the ''metre consists of a
'hexameter verse, with one made up of a dimeter iambic
and half a pentameter, appears to have most of the lyrical
spirit and character of the Odes. The poem, addressed
to a party of friends in winter, suggests comparison with
the 9th Ode‘of the First Book, “ Vides, ut alta stet nive
candidum,⁷⁷ also a winter song, but the occasion is very
different, and the spirit that pervades it not less so. Ode
ix. Lib. I. has no reference to public trouble53 unless,
indeed, a reader should indorse the very far-fetched sup-
position that verse 7, “Permitte divis caetera,'’ has a poli-
tical allusion. Its main image is in the picture of an
individual, and the happy mode in which, while yet young,
that individual may pass his day. Its tone is cheerful, and
with no insinuation of pathos. This epode, on the other
hand, is evidently addressed to friends excited by anxieties

and

Frowning storm has contracted the face of the heaven,
Rains and snows draw the upper air heavily down 3
Now the sea, now the forests, resound with the roar
Of wild Aquilo rushing from hill-tops on Thrace.
Seize, my. friends, on To—day—-÷foul orfair it is ours—
While yet firm are the knees, nor unseemly is J'oy 3
And let Gravity loosen his hold on the brows÷÷
Which he now overcasts with the cloud of his scowl.

³* “Obducta solvatur fronte senectuS.” “Obducta,” as if clouded
with care and sadness.—ORELL1. Orelli interprets “ senectus '' in the
sense of “ morositas‚’' “ taedium‚’' to which the word “ senium'’ is more
frequently applied. Macleane renders it “ melancholy,” in which sense,
however, he allows it is used nowhere else. I think the right meaning
is “gravity'' or “austerity‚⁷' in which sense it is employed by Cicero,
De Clar. Orat. 76, “ Plena litteratae senectutis oratio.’'
