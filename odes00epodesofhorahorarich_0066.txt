18 THE ODES· OF HORACE.

What the approach *by which Death could have daunted
‚Him who with eyelids> unmoistened beheld

Monster forms gliding and mountain waves swelling‚
And the grim Thunder—Crags dismally famed ?

Vainly by wastes of dissociable ocean
Providence severed the lands from the lands

If the plains not to be touched by our footfall
Be, yet, profanely o’er-leapt by our rafts.

Rushes man’s race through the evils forbidden,
Lawlessly bold to brave all things and bear:
Lawlessly bold did the son of the Titan
Bring to the nations fire won through a fraud.

F ire stolen thus from the Dome Empyrean‚
Meagre Decay swooped at once on the earth,

Leagued with a new-levied army of fevers—
Death‚ until then the slow·comer, far-off,

Hurried his stride, and stood faeing his victim 3
Daedalus, upward, the void realms of air

Sounded on wings that to man are not given 3
Down‚ burst the labour Herculean through hell.

Nought is too high for the daring of mortale ;
Heaven's very self in our folly we storm.

Never is Jove, through our guilty aspiring,
Suffered to lay down the bolt we provoke.
