70 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Silenee! hush, savage horn Berecynthiam! let the elash of
the timbrel be hushed,

Making music which Self-conceit follows, dull egotist reeling
stone-blind,

Idle Vainglory over-exalting her empty and arrogant head,

And a Faith which is lavish of secretS,â€”with bosom more
seen through than glaSS.
