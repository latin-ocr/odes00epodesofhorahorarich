90 ⁸ THE oDEs oF HORACE.

ODE XXVII.

TO BOON COMPANIONS.

In this poem, as in others of a convivial nature, Horace
transports himself as it were into the midst of the company,
and imparts an air of reality to an imaginary scene, so that
it seems as if actually an impromptu.

Brawl and fight over cups which were born but for pleasure ἦ

Is the custom in Thrace. Out on manners barbaric,
Do not put modest Bacchus to shame
By the scandal of bloody affrays.

In what strange want of keeping with wine-cups and lustres
Are the dirks of the Mede. Hush that infamous clamour,
Be quiet! Companions! seats—seats!
Lean in peace on prest elbows again Ξ

Do you wish me to share a Falernian so doughty?
Well then, let the young brother of Locrian Megilla
Reveal by what wound, by what shaft
He is smitten and dies—happy boy.

What, refuse? tut ἒ Ι drink on no other condition,
Come, no matter what Venus may conquer thee—blush not,
For we know that thy sins in that way
Must be always high-bred and refined.

Nay‚ thy secret is safe in these faithful ears whispered‚
Ha! indeed luckless wretch! whirled in what a Charybdis 1
How I pity thy struggles‚ O youth,
Thou, so worthy less dismal a flame 1
O what witch or, with potions Thessalian, what wizard—
Nay‚ what god could avail from such coils to release thee?
From that triple Chimaera's embrace
Scarce could Pegasus carry thee off.

by nature, and destined exclusively for that purpose. —ORELLL ⁴
