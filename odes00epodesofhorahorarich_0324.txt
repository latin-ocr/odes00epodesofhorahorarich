276 THE onEs OF HORACE.

ODE XVI.
GOLD THE CORRUPTOR.

This ode is among Horace's most striking variations of
the moral he so frequently preaches—content -vm‘sus gold.
But here he does full justice to the power of gold as the
corruptor. I have not adopted for this ode the forms of
metre I have elsewhere employed for rendering odes in the

am
The brazen tower‚ the solid doors,''“'‘ the vigil S e

Of dismal watch-dogs sentried night and day,
Might have sufficed to guard
From midnight loves imprisoned Danae 3

But Jove and Venus laughed to scorn Acrisius,
The timorous jailer of the hidden maid‚†
Opening at once sure way,
The god transformed himself into—a Bribe.

More subtle than the flash of the forked lightning,
Gold glides amidst the armed satellites 3 ’
More potent than Jove's holt,
Gold through the walls of granite bursts its way:

So fell the Argive Augur with his kindred,‡

Gain, tempting one, whelmed in destruction all 3
The man of Macedon §
By gifts cleft gateS‚ by gifts sapped rival thrones—

Gifts baited for fierce admirals‚ net whole navies 3 ΙΙ ’
Care grows with wealth, with wealth the greed for more.

 

⁴* “Robustaeque fores.'' Orelli suggests “fii-missimae,'’ and objects,
not without fine critical taste, to the interpretation of Foreellini and
others—viz„ “ oakm doors‚'' as a descent in poetic expression, just after
insisting on ‘⁶ brazen tower.’' Certainly, in line 9, Ode iii„ “ Illi robur
et aes triplex,” “ robur'' comes first.

Τ Acrisius shut up his daughter in a brazen tower from fear of the v
oracle‚ who had predicted that she should bear him a son who would
cause his death. He is therefore timorous or panio-stricken (pavidus)
, because of the oracle.
