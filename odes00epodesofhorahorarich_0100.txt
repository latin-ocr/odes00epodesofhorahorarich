52 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XIV.

THE SHIP—-AN ALLEGORY.

I know not what safer title for this poem can be
selected from the many assigned to it in the MSS. All or
most critics nowadays are agreed that it is a politica] allegory,
and not, as Graevius, Bentley, and others contended, an ad-

and in which his friends were about to re-embark. Quinctilian
illustrates the meaning of the word “allegory⁷' by a ref-

supported with much force by Buttmann is, that the poem
is addressed, not to the Commonweasth, but to a remnant
of the political party with which Horace had fought under
Brutus, and in remonstrance against their launching once

with reflective scholars, and has much in its favour. N 0-
thing in itself is more probable than that Horace should
have sought to express to his old comrades in an allegori-
cal poem his dissuasion from the hazardous junction with
