112 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Wherewith the fixed earth and the vagrant streams-
Wherewith the Styx and horror-breathing realms
Of rayless TaenaruS, shook—
Shook the world's end on Atlas. A god reignS,

Potent the high with low to interchange,

Bid bright orbs wane, and those obscure come forth·
Shrillingly Fortune swoops—

Here snatcheS‚ there exultant dropS, a crown.
