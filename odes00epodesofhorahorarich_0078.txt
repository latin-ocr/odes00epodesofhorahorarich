30 THE ODES OF HORACE.

As the white southern wind often clears clouds from ‘a sk'y'v
at its darkest,
Giving birth to no rain that is lasting‚

So, Plancus, let those weary houm, when life seems but
labour and sorrow;
Be lulled to their end in· the wine-cup 3
Or whether camps blazing with banners hold thee, or haply
hereafter
The shades of thine own tranquil Tibur.

When from Salamis and from his sire, Teucer was passing to
exile,
'Tis said that he crowned with the poplar*
Brows first besprinkled with drops from the strength-giving
boon of Lyaeus,
To friends as they sorrowed thus speaking:

“ Go wE wheresoever a fate more kind than the heart of a
parent
May bear us, associates and comrades 3
Despair of nought, Teucer your chief—of nought under aus-
pice of Teucer,
Unerring Apollo predicts us

“ A Salamis built on new soil, which Fame shall confound
with the lost one 3 †
Brave friends who have borne with me often
Worse things as men, let the wine chase ‘to-day every care
from the bosom, “
To-morrow—again the great Sea Plains.’'

⁴* Emblematic of courage and adventure. The poplar was consecrated
to Hercules.

† “Ambiguam tellure nova Salamina futuram ''—a new Salamis, which
might in future be confounded with the old one. The new Salamis was
in Cyprus.
