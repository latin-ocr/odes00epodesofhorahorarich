192 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XIX.

IN HONOUR OF BACCHUS.

Macleane appears to me greatly to underrate the beauty of
this poem, in which he says the Greek fire is wanting. This
is not the opinion of the earlier critics‚ nor of readers in
general. It has as much of the character of the dithyramb
as the taste of a Roman audience would sanction and the
character of the Latin language allow. The date of the

poem

Amid sequestered rocky glenS,—ye future times believe
it 2-
Bacchus I saw, in mystic verse his pupil ‘nymphs instruct-
1n —
{nstructing pricked ears intent
Of circling goat-hoofed Satyrs.

OEvoe‚ with the recent awe is trembling yet my spirit,
Filled with the god, my breast still heaves beneath the
stormy rapture.
OEvoel spare me 3 Liber, spare,
Dread with the solemn thyrsus 2

Vouchsafed to me the glorious right to chant the head-
strong Thyads‚
The wine that from the fountain welled‚ the rills with milk
o’erflowing,
And, from the trunks of charmed trees,
The lapse of golden honey.

Vouchsafed to sing thy consort’s crown which adds a star to
heaven‚⁹⁶

Or that just wrath which overwhelmed the house of Theban
Pentheus,

⁴* Ariadne.
