olive crop well, or that he 'had found a good‘investment for
his money, we might very well say to him, “ Put aside those
mercenary thoughts of gain, and come and sup with us.’'
There would be at once a J‘est and a compliment in the
irony of the implied accusation. That the Virgil addressed
must'be a vender of persumes, because he is asked to con·
tribute a pot of nard 3 or a banker or negotiator, because he
is exhorted to put aside the care of gain—and a scholiast in
a Paris MS. inscribes the ode, “Ad Virgilium Negotiator-
em,”—is a conjecture less plausible than that he was a physi-
cian of that name to the N eros, or a relation of C. Virgil
the praetor, Cicero's friend.

Orelli and Yonge quote with approval Gesner's remark,
“ That there is nothing in the poem itself which pertains
more to the poet Virgil than to any other friend of Horace’s.’'
On the other hand, it has been said that the mythological
imagery and* the description of Spring with which the poem
opens, are addressed with appropriate felicity to the Poet of

the Eclogues and Georgics.
The question does not seem to admit of positive solution

one way or the other. The reader must judge for himself
whether it is probable that Horace included in theFourth
Book a poem that, if addressed, to Virgil the poet, he must
have written many years before 3 and whether if he did thus,
as Dillenburger contends, seek to revive> the memory o'f his
early friend, it would have been in a poem of a compara-
tively light character, and so wholly free from any reference
to the loss he had sustained
