314 THE ODES OF HORACE.

“ What have Ι done? what left Ρθρ The crimes of virgins
A single death does not suffice to punish.
Am I awake? have Ι in truth committed

Sin, and so vilely?

“ Or‘am Ι guiltless—duped by a vain phantom
Leading a dream out of the ivory portal?
Could Ι indeed have left for watery deserts

² Home and the field-flowers ?

‘⁴ O that the bull were to my wrath delivered Ξ

O for a sword to hack his horns, and mangle

The monster now so hated, though so lately—
Woe is me l—worshipped.

“ Shameless‚ my household gods I have forsaken,

Shameless, I loiter on the road to Orcus Σ

Would to the gods that Ι were in the desert
Strayed among lions ἒ

“ While in these cheeks the bloom be yet unwithered‚

And all the sap of the luxuriant life-blood

Make their prey tempting‚ may this fatal beauty
Feast the fierce tigers.

“ Ι hear my absent father, ‘Vile Europa
Why pause to die? More ways than one, O coward Ξ
Here, at this elm—tree‚ strangled by thy girdle‚

Sole friend not cast off 3

“ ‘Or there, down yonder precipice‚ plunge headlong
Whirled by the storm-blast to thy grave in ocean 3
Unless, O royal-born‚ it please thee better,

Sold into bondage‚

* “ Unde quo veni.'¹ “ ‘ Unde ’ implies not that she was so distracted
that she had forgotten from whence she had come, but what an exchange
I have made. ''-—MACLEANE.
