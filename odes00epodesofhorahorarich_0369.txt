the course of the river and the mutability of human affairs,
or the simple grandeur of the lines on Fortune so¹ finely,

CARM. XXIX.

Tyrrhena regum progenies, tibi
Non ante verso lene merum cado,
Cum flore, Maecenas, rosarum, et
Pressa tuis balanus capillis

Jamdudum apud me est. Eripe te morae ,·
Ne semper udum Tibur,⁹⁵ et AEsulae †
Decliye contempleris arvum, et
Telegoni juga parricidae.

Fastidiosam desere copiam et

Molem propinquam nubibus arduis ;‡
Omitte mirari beatae

Fumum et opes strepitumque Romae.
