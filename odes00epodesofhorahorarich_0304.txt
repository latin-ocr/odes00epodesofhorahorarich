256 THE ODES OF HORACE.

O D E X.
To LYcE.

This humorous ode belong's to a kind of serenade com-
mon enough with the Greeks, and is probably imitated from
a Greek original. There is no reason for supposing the
Lyce whose cruelty is here complained of, to be identical
with the Lyce who is lampooned in Book IV. Ode xiii.

Didst thou drink the iced water of uttermost Don‚

O Lyce l of some cruel savage the spouse,

Still, thy heart with compassion might think of me stretched
Where the north winds are quartered outside of thy door.

Hark 1 the hinge of thy gate 3 hark 1 the plants in thy hanff
With what dissonant howl they re-echo the blasts,
And, oh Ξ how the chaste congelation of air

Adds a yet purer coating of frost to the snow Σ

Lay the haughtiness hateful to Venus aside, ,
Lest the wheel should run back and the rope should be
snappedsl·
Thy good Tyrrhene father ne’er meant to beget
A Penelope cruel to suitors in thee.

Ah 1 although thou art proof against presents and prayers,
And the pale-blue complexion of lovers disdained 3

ι Nor ev’n bowed to revenge on the spouse led astray

By a roving Pierianss less chaste than a Muse 3

⁴* ‘⁴ Nemus Inter pulchra satum tecta.'' Small trees were sometimes
planted round the impluvium of a Roman house. This is the interpre-
tation adopted by Orelli. Ritter contends that the line refers to one of

the two sacred groves situated between the two heights of the Capitoline. r
