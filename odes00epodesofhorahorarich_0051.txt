BOOK I.-—ODE I.

DEDICATORY ODE TO MAECENAS.

IT is doubtful whether this ode was composed as a dedi-
catory preface to the first three books, or only to Book I. ε
the former supposition is more generally favoured. The
poet condenses a rapid survey of the various objects of
desire and ambition, commencing with the competition of
the Olympic games, and passing from that reference to the
Greeks, to the pursuits of his own countrymen in the emula—
tion for power, the acquisition of riches, and so on, through
the occupations and tastes of mankind in that busy world
from which, at the close, he intimates that he himself is set
apart. Ι

The punctuation and construction of theffifth and sixth
lines of the ode have been a matter of much dispute.
Maclean e, sanctioned by Mr George Long—-and Munro, sup-
ported “by the emphatic advocacy of Dr Kennedy''—adopt
the reading which puts an end to the sentence at “ nobilis,’'
and j0ins on “Terrarum dominos evehit ad Deos ” to what
follows. By this reading, the lords of earth, or masters of the
world, are neither (according to Orelli and most modern corn-
mentators) taken in apposition with “ Deos,'' as in Ovid, Ep.
ex Ponte, i. 9, 3 5, sq.—

“ Nam tua non alio coluit penetralia ritu
Terrarum dominos quarn colis ipse Deos ;''

nor, according ‘to elder commentators‚ approved by Ritter, is
the term applied t'o regal or lordly competitors in the Greek
games, such as Gelo, Hiero, &c. “ Terrarum dominos ”
