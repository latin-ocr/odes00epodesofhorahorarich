380 THE ODEs OF HORACE.

ODE VIII.

TO CENSORINUS.

On stated timeS, as in the Kalends of March and January,
it was the custom of the wealthier Romans to make presents
to their friends. To this custom Horace refers, sending his
verses to Censorinus, as the most acceptable gift he could
offer. C. Marcus Censorinus was a man of consular rank,
bore a high reputation, and died greatly regretted.

Goblets and bronzes rare, my Censorinus,
I on my friends would heartily bestow 3

I’d give them tripods, as Greece gave her heroes-—
Nor should the meanest of my gifts be thine,

Were I but rich in artful masterpieces
Such as a Scopas or Parrhasius wrought,⁹‘

When one in stone, in liquid hues the other,
Now fixed a mortal, now enshrined a god.

Not mine that wealth,† nor do such dainty treasures
Fail to thine affluence nor allure thy mind 3

That which charms tlzee is song x song I can proffer,
And set a value on the gift I bring.
Marbles inscribed with a state’s grateful praises,
Wherein great chieftains live and breathe again :
The flights‡ of Hannibal, his threats hurled backward,
And impious Carthage perishing in flames,

Made not more famed than did C-alabrian Muses
Him who bore off from conquered Africa

As his own spoils—a Name.§ Nor aught thy guerdon,
If scrolls be mute upon thy deeds of good.

 

 

‘⁸‘ Scopas was a famous sculptor of Paros, according to Pausanias,
flou'rishing about 450 years B.C. Parrhasius, a painter‚ native of Ephe·
