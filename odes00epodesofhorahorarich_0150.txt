ODE XXX.

vENUs 1Nv01<ED To GLYCERA’S FANE.

This ode has the air of a complimentary copy of
verses to some sair freed-woman who had fitted up a

pretty fane to Venus, probably in the grotto‚ or antrum, at—
tached to her residence.

Venus, O queen of Cnidos and of Paphos,

Spurn thy loved Cyprus—here transfer thy presence z

Deeked is the fane to which, with incense lavish,
Glycera calls thee.

Bring with thee, glowing rosy red, the Boy-god,

Nymphs and loose-girdled Graces, and—if Α wanting

Thee, wanting charm—bring Youth‚ nor let persuasive ᾗ
Mercury fail us.

⁴* For the addition of this explanatory epithet‚ see the notes of Orelli-
and Dillenburger.
