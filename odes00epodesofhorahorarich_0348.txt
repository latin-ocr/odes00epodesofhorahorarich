300 THE ODES OF HORACE.

No dowered she-despot rules her lord, nor trusts
The wife’s protection to the leman's splendour.³⁵

There, is the dower indeed magnificent l
Ancestral virtue, chastity unbroken,

Shrinking with terror from all love save one 3
Or death the only sentence for dishonour.

Oh, whosoe'er would banish out of Rome
Intestine rage and fratricidal slaughter‚

If he would have on reverent statues graved
This holy title, “ Father of his Country‚'’

Let him be bold enough to strike at vice,
Curb what is now indomitable—Licence,

And earn the praise of after time Ξ Alas 1

Virtue we hate while seen alive ; when vanished,
We seek her—but invidiously3 and right
⁵ The virtue dead to wrong some virtue living.

But what avails the verbiage of complaint—

To rail at guilt, yet punish not the guilty?
What without morals profit empty laws ?

If nor that zone, which, as his own enclosure,

The Sun belts round with fires——nor that whose soil
Is ice‚ the hard land bordering upon Boreas-
Scare back the avarice of insatiate trade,
And oceans are the conquests of the sailor3

1f dread to encounter the supreme reproach
Of poverty‚ ordains to do and suffer
All things for profit, and desert as bare
The difficult way that only mounts to virtue ?

⁴* “Nec nitido fidit adultero. ” Maeleane follows Orelli in consider—
ing that this means that she does not trust to the influence of the adulterer
to protect her from the anger of the husband.
