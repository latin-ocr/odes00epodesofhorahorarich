148 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE VII.

TO POMPEIUS VARUS.

With thee did I share field and flight of Philippi,
Where I left, not too bravely, behind me, my buckler,†
When valour was broken, and tongues
That threatened so loudly, licked dust.

Swiftly me the god Mercuryss bore through the foemen,
Buoyed aloft in thick cloud—all secure, yet all trembling—
Thee the whirlpool of battle again
Dragged back in the roar of its surge.

Philippi has been very harshly perverted into a proof of eowardice— '
