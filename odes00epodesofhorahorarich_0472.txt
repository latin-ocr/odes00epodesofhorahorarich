424 THE EPODES oF HORACE.

’ Of brisk Apulian‚ in the cares of household
And of sweet children bears her joyous part3
Who on the sacred hearth the oldest fagots
Piles 'gainst the coming of her wearied lord 3
And in the wattled close the milch-kine penning,
Drains the distended udders of their load 3
From the sweet cask draws forth the year's new vintage,
And spreads the luxuries of an unbought feast ι

of it than that it was speckled. The “ attagen ’' is variously interpreted
woodcock, snipe‚ and, more commonly, moorfowl. The Ionian snipe
is to this day so incomparably the best of the snipe race, that Ι venture
to think it is the veritable “ attagen Ionicus.’'

the primitive rustic life, in which the labourers, familiarly with the master,
