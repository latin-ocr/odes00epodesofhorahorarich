It is uncertain whether “ felix ’' refers to Horace, as “happy in the re-
turn of Caesar,’' or to the sun, forming part of the exclamati0n3 Mac-
leane leaves the choice to the reader’s taste 3 Vossius and others prefer
the latter application ; Orelli considers the former more tender. To me
it seems more according to the genius of lyrical composition to apply
the epithet to the sun. We know already that Horace is happy in the
return of Caesar, otherwise he would not be joining in the procession and

THE ODES OF HORACE.

Looks from the car which, up the sacred hill,
Drags the Sygambri3

He, than whom never to this earth have Fate

And kind gods given, nor shall give, ev'n if yet

The Golden Age corne back to mortals, aught
Better or greater.

Chant thou the games that honour the return

Of brave Augustus granted to our prayer ;

The joyousfeast-days, the hushed courts of law,
Vacant of suitors.

Then, too, if aught that Ι can Speak be heard,

My voice shall aid to swell the choral hymn,

And sing “ All hail, thou fair auspicious sun,÷÷
Bringing back Caesar 1''

And while, O god of triumph, slowly on†

He moves in state, shout upon shout repeats

“ 'Io Triumphe 1 ⁷' through the length of Rome 3
Frankincense steaming

Up to benignant gods. Ten bulls, ten kine,

Aequit thy vow 3 a single steerling mine,

Fresh-weaned, and browsing into youth amid
Prodigal pastures 3

⁴* “Et‚ O Sol

Pulcher! O laudande! canam, recepto
’ Caesare felix.”
