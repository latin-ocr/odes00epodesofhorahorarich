48 THE ODES OF HORACE,

Father and Guardian of all human races,

Saturnian Jove, to thee the Fates have given

Charge o'er great Caesar 3 mayst thou reign supremely,
Next to thee Caesar.

vr!

Whether the Parthians over Rome impending
Grace his full ÷÷ triumph, or the farthest dwellers‚
Indian and Seric, upon Orient margins

Under the sunrise,†

Wide earth with justice he shall rule, thy viceroy 3

With awful chariot Thou shalt shake Olympus 3

Thou through the sacred groves profaned impurely
Launch angry lightnings.‡

ᾖ “Justo triumpho. '' “ ‘Justo‚' ‘ regular, full, complete,' in which
sense this adjective is attached to such nouns as exercitus, legio, acies,
praelium, victoria.’'—YONGE.

Τ “ Sive subjectos Orientis orae
Seras et Indos.'’

The Seres, whom some conjecture to be the Chinese, represent the na-
tions at the farthest east known to the Romans. “ Subjectos orae,”
“ under the edge or extremity of the East.'’—-YONGE.

ss “ Tu gravi curru quaties Olympum,
Tu parum castis inimica mittes
Fulmina lucis.''

The general meaning seems to be, that Jove left the political govem-
ment of earth to Augustus, his vicegerent3 but he reserved to himself
alone the dominion of heaven, and the task of avenging such crimes as
offended the gods, or polluted the sanctity of the temples.
