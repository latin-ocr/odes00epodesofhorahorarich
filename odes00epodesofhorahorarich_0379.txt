THE SECULAR HYMN. 331

probably by Sulla, to fifteen (quindecimviri), were ordered
to consult those oracles, and they reported that the time
was come to revive the old Tarentine games. They intro-
duced, however, certain innovationS, such as the cyclical
or secular period, for their celebration (pretending that such
periods had been always observed, or at least enjoined),
and the substitution of Apollo and Diana for Dis and
Proserpina. The latter change seems natural enough.
Diana had among her attributes those of Proserpina, and
Apollo was the deity whom Augustus especially honoured
as his patron god. Dis and Proserpina were no longer
in fashion‚ and were probably never very popular with the
genuine Romans 3 while, as the festival was not designed,
like the old Tarentine games, for' the averting of some
national calamity or mortal disease, but rather to attest the
blessings enjoyed under the Empire, and implore their con-
tinuance, the direct invocation of the infernal divinities
would have been very inappropriate 3 and, indeed, their
powers as averters of evil had become transferred to Apollo
and Diana (as the sun and moon), who were also the be-
stowers of good. Sacrifices were, however, offered to Dis
and Proserpina on the first day of the ceremony among
other gods, in the list o‘f whom they are placed last.
Still it may be seen in the following Hymn that much of
the original character of the Tarentine or Taurian games
was retained, however modified to suit altered circumstances.
Diana is especially implored to protect 'mothers and mature
their offspring. Augustus approaches the altar with white
steers for sacrifice, as cows had been sacrificed to Dis in the
Taurian games (though, as black animals had been offered to
the infernal deities in time of calamity, the white colour of
< the steers was significant of the change to celestial divinities
and the felicity of the period), and the games commenced
in the Tarentum—i.e., the same ground that had been con-
secrated to the Tarentine games, The nature and order of
the ceremonies, which lasted three days and three nights‚
