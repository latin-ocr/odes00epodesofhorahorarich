430 THE EPODEs OF HORACE.

EPODE IV.

AGAINST AN UPSTART;

All the scholiasts agree in considering that the person
satirised in this ode was the freedman Menas, lieutenant to
Sextus Pompeius, who deserted to Augustus A.U.C. 716.
Modern critics have objected to this assumption, and their
objections are tersely summed up and answered by Mac-

leane

As tow'rds the wolf the lamb’s inborn repugnance
Nature makes my antipathy to thee,
Thou on whose flank still burns the Iberian whipcord‚⁴⁰‘
Thou on whose limbs still galls the bruise of chains,
Strut as thou wilt in arrogance of purse-pride,
Fortune can change not the man's natiVe breed.
Mark, as along the Sacred Way'r thou flauntest,
Puffing thy toga, twice three cubits wide ’ζ-
Mark with what frankness indignation loathes thee,
Seen in the looks of every passer-by ἐξ
“ He, by Triumvirs so inured to lashes,
As tired the public crier to proclaim, Η
Now ploughs some thousand fat F alernian acres,
And wears the Appian Road out with his nags3

 

ἥ “ Iberieis funibus.’' These were cords made of ‘⁴ spartum‚'’ usually
said to be the Spanish broom. It was made into ropes‚'especially for
ships' rigging. ‘⁶ It may be added, in favour of the theory which makes
Menas the hero, that the mention of Spanish ropes seems to imply that
the person had suffered on board ship, if not in the country itself, since,
as Pliny tells us, ropes of spartum were especially used in ships; and
the only way to give point to the epithet is to suppose it had reference
to Spain itself', or to the fleet.''—-MACLEANE.

’ἱ- The Sacred Way, leading to the Capitol, was the favourite lounge
of the idlers. ⁸
