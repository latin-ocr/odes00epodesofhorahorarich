228 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Earth heaped above them mourns her buried monsters,
And wails her offspring, into lurid Orcus
Hurled by the heavenly bolt 3
The swiftest fires consume not AEtna, piled

Over the struggling giant 3⁹⁵ the-winged jailer†
Of lustful Tityus never quits its captive 3

Three hundred setters hold
The ravisher Pirithous fast in hell.

Excmzsus,

“ Me fabulosae Volture in Apulo
Altricis extra limen Apuliae
Ludo fatigatumque somn0.''

I omit in the translation the adjective Apulian (Apulo)
applied to Vultur, because, as between Apulo in one line
and Apuliae 1n the next, the text is generally supposed to be

corrupt. Apu(lo) 1n the first line, is Apu(liae) 1n the second3
and

³* ‘⁶ N ee peredit
Impositam celer ignis AEtnam.'’

The fires of AEtna‚ however swiftly they burst forth, cannot consume
the heap piled above Enceladus, so as ever to free him.—ORELL1.
Horace does not say who was the giant crushed under AEtna. Calli-
machus says it was Enceladus, and also Briareus3 Pindar and AEschylus
say it was Typhoeus. 1 have left this question in the translation as
vague as Horace leaves it, though Ι have been compelled to take the
licence of adding the words, “the struggling giant,” in order to pre-
vent a misconception of the meaning,-—such as occurS, for instance,
in Smart, ‘⁴ Nor does the active fire consume AEtna‚ that is placed

over it. ”
Τ The vulture.
