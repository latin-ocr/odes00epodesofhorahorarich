INTRODUCTION. xli

—which in Orelli, and indeed in Macleane, is so sparse as
not unfrequently to render the sense obscure to those not
familiarly intimate with it—-I am largely indebted to the
admirable edition of Mr Yonge. The modes of spelling pre-
ferred by Ritter and Mr Munro as more faithful transcripts
of the ancient MSS„ involve questions of great interest to
professional scholarS, but are as yet too unfamiliar to the
general reader for adoption in a text especially designed for
his use, and annexed to the English translation for the con-
venient facilities of reference and comparison.

My objects in the task I have undertaken have compelled
me to add in some degree the labour of a critic to those of
a translator. The introductions prefixed and the notes
appended to the several odes are designed not only to serve
for readers unacquainted with the original, but to bring, in
a terse and convenient form, before such students of Horace
as may not have toiled through the many and often conflict-
ing commentaries of the best editors, the opinions of eminent
authorities upon difficult or disputed questions of interpreta-
tion. In my notes will be seen the extent to which Ι am
indebted not only to Dillenburger, Orelli, Ritter, but to our
own recent English editors, Macleane aml Yonge—and, on
certain points of controverted interpretation, to Mr Munro's
erudite and valuable introduction to the beautiful edition
illustrated from antique gems, by Mr King.

The majority of critics concur in the doctrine that all the
Odes in Horace, differing in this respect from the Epodes,
consist of stanzas in four lines, as the Alcaic and Sapphic
do. This opinion has been ably controverted by Ritter.
Munro declines either to affirm or deny it. But conformably
to the general opinion, I have treated, and so translated, the
Odes as quatrains, with four exceptions, for which I subjoin
my reasons,

Odes i. Book 1., xxx. Book ΙΙΙ., and viii. Book IV., are
in the same metre, and the only ones that are 3 but Ode viii.
