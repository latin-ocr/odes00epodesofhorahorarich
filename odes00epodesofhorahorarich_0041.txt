deficiencies or those of the Latin language, he falls far short
of the Greek lyrical poets in fire, in passion, in elevation of
style, in varied melodies of versification. Granted: but judg-
ing by the scanty remains of those poets which time has
spared, we find evidence of no one,——unless it be Alcaeus,
and conjecturing what his genius might have been* as a
whole less by the fragments it has left than by Horace’s

Of all Classical authors Horace is the one who has most
attracted the emulation of editors and Commentators. Stu-
dents, indeed, have some reason to complain of the very
‘ attempts made by learning and ingenuity to determine his
text and interpret his meaning. No sooner have they accus-
