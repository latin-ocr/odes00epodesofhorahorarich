47.ss THE EPODEs OF HORACE.

Giving back to limbs bristled* the voice and the reason,· ·
And the glory that dwells in the aspect of Man.
Enough‚ and much more than enough, for all penance
Thy wrath has inflicted, O greatly beloved—
O greatly beloved both by huckster and sailorl ἢ·
. Fled away from my formis the vigour of youth,
And the blush- -rose of health from my cheeks has departed‚
Leaving nought but pale bones scantly covered with
skin.
And my hair is grown grey with. the spell of thy persumes 3
From my suffering Ι snatch not a moment’s repose.
Still the night vexes day, and still day the night vexes 3
Ι can free not the lungs strained with gaspings for breath.‡
Wherefore, wretch that Ι am, Ι confess myself conquered3
Ι acknowledge the truth I had dared to deny 3
Yes, the chant of a Samnite can rattle a bosom,
And the Marsian’s witch-ditty can split up a head 1
What more wouldst thou have? Earth and Sea! Ι am
hotter
T han Alcides in fell Nessian venom imbued‚
Or than Sicily’s flame budding fresh in fierce AEtn1a.§
Dost thou mean, then, for ever to keep up this fire—

Levare tenta spiritu praecordia.”

The symptoms described are those of a real malady — emaciation,
sever, sleeplessness‚ difficulty of breathing-—a malady familiar enough
to those who have experienced an Italian malaria. The whole poem
seems to me to have the air of being written at some period of actual
illness‚ in the attempt to draw amusement from humorous exaggeration
of his own complaints, which is common enough among witty invalids.
The nature of the poem would perhaps scarcely suggest itself to him if
he were quite well m health at the time.
