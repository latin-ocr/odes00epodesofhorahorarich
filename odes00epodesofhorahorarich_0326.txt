278 THE onEs OF HORACE.

O my Maecenas 1 gem
Of Roman knighthood,⁹⁵ ever have Ι feared

isTo list a crest above the crowd conspicuous—-
Rightly3 the more man shall deny himself,

The more shall gods bestow.
I do not side with wealth, but, lightly armed,

Bound o’er the lines, deserting to Contentment 3
Owner more grand in means the rich despise,

Than were Ι said to hide,
In mine own granaries, all Apulia yields

Her toiling sons, want-pinched amidst heaped plenty :—
A brooklet pure, some roods of woodland cool,

F aith in crops, sure if small—
Are a lot happier, though he knows it not,

Than his who glitters in the spoils of Afric.
Though not for me toil the Calabrian bees,
Nor wines in Formian jars
Languish their fire in length of years away,

Nor fleecy wools gain weight in Gallie pastures,
Yet Penury keeps aloof3 nor, lacked I more,

More wouldst thou me deny:
Widening my means by narrowing my desires‚

Ι shall have ampler margin for true riches
Than if to Lydia adding Phrygian realms.
Who covets much, much wants 3
'God gives most kindly giving just enough.

ἦ “ Maecenas, equitum decus.’' By this significant reference to
Maecenas as the ornament of knighthood, Horace. associates Maecenas
withhimself in the philosophy of contentment—Maecenas‚ having always
remained in the equestrian order, to which he was born, declining pro-¹

motion to the senatorial.
