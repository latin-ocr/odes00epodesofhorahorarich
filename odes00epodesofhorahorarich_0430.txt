382 THE ODEs oF HORACE.

Though son of Mars and Ilia, what—had silence
Been his worth's cold obstruction—Romulus?

The genius, favour, voice of powerful poets
Consecrate AEacus, from waves of Styx

Ravished to golden isles.⁹⁵ The Muse permits not
The mortal worthy of her praise to die 3

Him the Muse hallows to the bliss of heaven.
Thus in the longed-for banquet-hall of Jove

Sits resolute Hercules3 the sons of Leda
Thus—one twin-star—from Ocean's nether deep

Snatch tempest-shattered barks 3 and thus doth Liber,
His brows adorned with the vine’s lusty green,

Hear as a god our mortal supplications,
And guide the votive prayer to happy endS.

two verses, of which no traces are to be found in the oldest MSS. and
commentators.’' Macleane thinks “that the confusion is easily seen
through by those who avoid the commentators and judge for themselves.

elder'?'' To me the meaning seems clear enough. Just as Horace,
Lib. 1.‚ Carm. xii. v. 46, makes the name of Marcellus, who took Syra·
cuse‚ stand for all his family, and include the young Marcellus, so he
here makes the name of Africanus stand for the whole family, and in-
clude especially the younger Scipio. Or, as Ritter expresses it, the
fame of the elder Scipio, recorded by Ennius, was revived in the destruc-
tion of Carthage by the younger.

⁴* “ Virtus et favor et lingua potentium

Vatum divitibus consecrat insulis.''
“ ‘Virtus et favor’ are generally taken, like ‘lingua,’ as belonging to
‘potentium vatum,' so that ‘ virtus ' is ‘ vis ingenii, facultas poetica.’ I
doubt the accuracy of that interpretation ; Ι think it rather means that
though AEacus was virtuous (and he was much celebrated for his justice),
his virtue would not have raised him to the skies but for the applause
