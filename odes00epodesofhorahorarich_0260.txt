212 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE III.
oN STEADFASTNESS OF PURPOSE.

The two preceding odeS, addressed to youth, inculcate
the formation of private character3 this ode and the two
that follow have a political intention and bearing. In this
ode Horace commences with his famous picture of the
steadfast man not turned aside from that which his reason
and conscience hold to be right, either by the excitement of
a populace or the threat of a tyrant. Among the mortals
which the exercise of this virtue has raised to the gods he
places Augustus, who certainly did not want firmness of pur-
pose in founding and cementing his authority, and to whom
the Senate had already decreed the honours habitually paid
only to the divine powers. The poet’s mention of Romulus
amongst those thus promoted to the rank of immortals,
leads on to what in itself appears, at first sight, a somewhat
prolix and irrelevant digression—viz„ the speech of Juno
predicting the glories of Rome, and prohibiting the resto-
ration of Troy. Closely examined, the digression is not
purely episodical, but in harmony with the preceding verses,
and a development of the purpose of the whole poem ; for
it is in the nature of the steadfast man, unswayed by the
fickle passions of the time, to adhere firmly to the interests
of his country, and cherish the memory of its glories and
heroes. We are told by Suetonius (‘ Life of Julius Caesar,'
c. 79), that it was a current report that Julius Caesar medi-
tated a design of transferring the seat of empire from Rome
to Alexandria, or to Ilium. Lucan, ix. 997, ascribes to him
the same intention. But we are not to suppose, with some,

that Augustus entertained any such notion: this ode in
itself

Not the rage of the million commanding things evil,
Not the doom frowning near in the brows of the tyrant,
