BOOK IV.—ODE VII. 377

Aulus TorquatuS‚ of whom Nepos speaks in his Life of
Atticus, c. 11, who had served with Brutus and Cassius
at Philippi, and was therefore Horace's old fellow-soldier.
Macleane considers the poem to be one of Horace’s earlier
odes, and introduced to swell the fasciculus—or, as we
should say, fill up the volume. I do not see much cause
for that supposition. The sentiment is one habitual to
Horace at every stage of his life, and it is in harmony with
the tone of the epistle, published probably five or six years
before the F ourth Book of Odes.

CARM. VII.

Diffugere nives: redeunt jam gramina campis
Arboribusque comae 3

Mutat terra vices et decrescentia ripas
Flumina praetereunt 3

Gratia cum Nymphis geminisque sororibus audet
Ducere nudachoros.

Immortalia ne spereS, monet Annus et almum
Quae rapit Hora diem.

Frigora mitescunt Zephyris, Ver proterit AEstas
Interitura, simul

Pomifer Auctumnus fruges effuderit, et mox
Bruma recurrit iners.

Damna tamen celeres reparant caelestia lunae ᾖ
Nos, ubi decidimus,

Quo pater AEneas, quo TulluS, † dives et Ancus,
Pulvis et umbra sumus.‡

 

. brings back the seasons—time does not bring back us men when we
once vanish.

† Ritter has “ Tullus, dives et Ancus,” not “ dives Tullus‚” observing
that there is no just cause for calling Tullus rich, whereas the riches
of Ancus were celebrated. Munro adopts Ritter's collocation.
