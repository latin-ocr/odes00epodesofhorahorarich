xvi THE ODES OF HORACE.

he has poetised a practica] philosophy which, even in its
inconsistencies, establishes a harmony with our own incon-
sistent natures 3 for most men are to this day in part Epi-
curean, in part Stoic. Horace is the DQ of Eclecticism.
From the width of his observation‚ and the generalising
character of his reasoning powers, Horace 552AEinss gm-

to provincial narrowness of mind or vulgarity of taste, to
false finery and affected pretence, is the essential attribute of
‘the son of the Venusian freedman. And with this quality,

which needs for brilliant development familiar converse with
