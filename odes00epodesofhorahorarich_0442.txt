394 THE* ODEs OF ¹ HORACE.

ODE XII.
INVITATION To V1RG1L.

It is a vexed question among commentators whether the
Virgil here addressed be Virgil the poet. Yonge says that
the general authority of critics is against that identification.
Macleane is disposed to favour it, and it is not without other
and very eminent defenders.

The main objections to the assumption are—Ist, the
chronological one. Virgil was dead many years before the
publication of the Fourth Book ; but, in answer to this, it is
said that, in making up the collection composed for Book
IV., Horace might have included poems composed at a
much earlier date. Dillenburger considers that this ode was
written in youth, and published in the final book of the
Odes, as if Horace wished to refresh and record the memory
of his friend.

2d, It is asked, “How can Virgil the poet be called
the client of noble youths ?'’ To this it has been replied,
that the youths referred to might be the stepsons of Augus-
tus, or (more generally by Dillenburger), that the phrase
means nothing more than the familiarity with persons of
high station, such as Agrippa, Pollio, and others.

3d, That an injunction to lay aside the care or study of
gain (studium lucri) is very inappropriate to the liberal and
generous character assigned to the poet. But here again it
is said, that it is absurd to take literally what is obviously
written in jest. If a man, the most indifferent to gain, had,
for instance, informed us that he thought he could sell an

olive

Now Thracian breezes‚ comrades of the spring,

Temper the ocean and impel the sails 3

Frost crisps not now the fields, nor rage the floods,
Swollen with winter snows
