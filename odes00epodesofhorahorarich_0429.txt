CARM. VIII.

Donarem pateras grataque commodus,
Censorine, meis aera sodalibus 3

Donarem tripodas, praemia fortium
Graiorum ; neque tu pessima munerum

Ejus, qui domita nomen ab Africa§
Lucratus rediit, clarius indicant

of Ennius 3 and it cannot be supposed that Horace was so ignorant as to
ascribe to the elder Scipio the act of the younger. It was even proposed
by Bentley to omit the seventeenth verse, referring to Carthage, alto-
gether ; but the line is in all the MSS. extant. Others suggest that two
lines are wanting aster the seventeenth, which would have removed the
alleged confusion; and this theory is supported by the assertion that
odes in this measure are so constituted as to be reducible to stanzas of
