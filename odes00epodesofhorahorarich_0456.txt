408 THE ODEs oF HORACE.

ODE XV.
To AUGUSTUS ON THE RESTORATION oF PEACE.

This ode is the appropriate epilogue to the Fourth Book,
of which the poems that celebrate the Roman victories under
Drusus and Tiberius consitute the noblest portion. If it be
true that the book was published on account of these odes,
and at the desire of Augustus, Horace would naturally con-
clude by a special reference to the beneficial issues of the
wars undertaken by Augustus, and from the final completion
of which in Gaul, Germany, and Spain, he had just returned

to Rome. Horace here begins by saying, that when he
wished

Of wars and vanquished cities when I longed
To sing, Apollo checked me with his lyre,
Lest I launched sails so slight
Into so vast a deep. Caesar, thy reign

Has given back golden harvests to our fields 3
Our standards, torn from Parthia's haughty walls,
Restored to Roman Jove 3
Closed gates of Janus, vacant of a war 3

To righteous order rampant licence curbed,
Thrust from the state the vices* which defiled,
And, in their stead, recalled
The ancient virtues to their fatherland,†——-

 

³⁶ “ Emovitque culpas.’' This refers to the moral reforms undertaken
by Augustus, such as the Julian law, “ de adulteriis et de pudicitia.”

'1‘ “ ‘ Veteres artes.' ‘ Artes ' here means ‘virtues‚’ as in Book III.
Od. iii. ⁶ Hac arte' (ἀρετῆ), as prudence, fortitude, justice, temperance.''
—ACRON.
