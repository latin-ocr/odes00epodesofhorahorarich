THE ODES OF HORACE.

“ Or the chariot-chase, fearlessly follow ε

Medon, t00‚ thou shalt know‚——but look yonder‚

Through the battle comes raging to find thee
Tydides, more dread than his sire !

“ Ah! from him, as a hart in the valley

Sees the wolf and forgetteth its pastum,

All unnerved and deep-panting thou fliest 5
Not such was the pledge to thy love !

“ Though the wrath in the fleet of Achilles
Bring a respite to Troy and Troy’s mothers ;

Ilion's domes, after winters predestined,
Shall sink in the flames of the Greek !’'
