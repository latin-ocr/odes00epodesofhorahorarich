154 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Meanwhile, new youths grow up beneath thy thraldom ς

Grow up new slaveries 3 and the earlier lovers

Threaten each day to quit thy faithless threshold—
Threaten, and throng there.

For their raw striplings tremble all the motherS‚

And all the fathers of a thrifty temper3

And, as a gale retarding home-bound husbands‚³‘
Weeping brides fear thee.

⁴* “Tua ne retardet
Aura maritos.”

There are many conjectures as to the sense of the word “ aura ’⁹ in this
passage, for which see Orelli‘s note. Yonge interprets it “ a metaphor
for influence. ’⁹
