174 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XIV.
To POSTUMUS.

Who this Postumus may have been is, in spite of the
various conjectures of various commentators, as uncertain
as, happily, it is immaterial. It is, at all events, an agree-
able supposition that he may be identical with the Postumus

whom

Postumus, Postumus, the years glide by uS,
Alas! no piety delays the wrinkles,
Nor old age imminent,
Nor the indomitable hand of Death.

Though thrice each day a hecatomb were offered,
Friend, thou couldst soften not the tearless Pluto,
Eneoiling Tityus vast,
And Geryon, triple giant, with sad waves—

Waves over which we all of us must voyage,
All whosoe'er the fruits of earth have tasted ;
Whether that earth we ruled
As kings, or served as drudges of its soil.

Vainly we shun Mars and the gory battle,
Vainly the Hudrian hoarse with stormy breakers,
Vainly, each autumn's fall,
The sieklied airs through which the south wind sauls*

Still the dull-winding ooze of slow Cocytus,
The ill-famed Danaids, and, to task that ends not
Sentenced, AEolides 3
These are the sights on which we all must gaze.

⁴* “ Auster‚” “the sirocc0.”
