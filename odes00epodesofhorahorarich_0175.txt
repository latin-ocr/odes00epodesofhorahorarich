himself up to literature. His tragedies, of which there
are no remains, are highly praised by Virgil, who says they
were worthy of Sophocles. Porphyrion says he was the only
one of his time who could write tragedy well. But the author
of the ‘ Dialog. de Oratoribus’ asserts that both as a tragic
writer and an orator his style was hard and dry. His history
appears to have been in seventeen books 3 and it is after having
heard him read a part of it (he is said to have introduced at
Rome the custom of such readings to assemblieS, more or less
familiar, before publication) that we may suppose Horace to
have written the ode, of which the date is uncertain. Pollio
appears to have been one of the most truly illustrious‚ and
certainly one of the most accomplished‚ personages of the
Augustan era.

CARM I.

Motum ex Metello consule civicum,
Bellique causas et vitia et modos,
Ludumque Fortunae, gravesque
Principum amicitias, et arma

Nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus,
Periculosae plenum opus aleae,
Tractas 'et incedis per ignes
Suppositos cineri doloso.

Paullum severae Musa tragoediae
Desit theatris : mox ubi publicas
Res ordinaris, grande munus

Cecropio repetes cotlsurno,

Insigne maestis praesidium reis ’
Et consulenti, Pollio, curiae,
Cui laurus aeternos honores
’ Delmatico peperit triumpho.
