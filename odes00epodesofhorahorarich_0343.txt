BOOK III.—ODE XXIII: 295

not be Horace's servant, for she is represented as sacrificing
according to her own choice and will. But this no servant
could do : the act of sacrifice for the whole family belonged
exclusively'to' the head of the establish'ment. The ode, if
addressed to any individual at all—which it probably was
not—would have been addressed, therefore, to some mistress
of a plain country household. ’

CARM. XXIII.

Caelo supinas si tuleris manus
N ascente Luna, rustica Phidyle,
Si thure placaris et horna
Fruge Lares, avidaque porca,

N ec pestilentem sentiet Africum ’ἕ
Fecunda vitis, nec sterilem seges
Robiginem, aut dulces alumni

Pomifero grave tempus anno.

Nam, quae nivali pascitur Algido
Devota quercus inter et ilices,
Aut crescit Albanis in herbis‚†
Victima pontificum secures

Cervice tinget : te nihil attinet
Tentare multa caede bidentium
