EPODE 111. 427

it a bad joke, and he takes revenge upon the chief criminal,
garlic‚ in the following humorous anathema.

The commentators in general assume that Horace could
not have taken the liberty to refer to Terentia in the con-
cluding lines, “ Manum puella,'' &C., and that the poem was
therefore written before Maecenas’s marriage, probably A.U.C.
719 or 720. Ritter, on the contrary, denounces with much
indignation the idea that Horace could impute the inde-
corum of so familiar an intercourse with a freedwoman to
a man of the grave occupations and dignified position of
Maecenas, and insists on applying “puella ’' to Terentia, in
which case the poem would be written shortly after the

marriage of Maecenas, which Ritter chooses to date, A.U.C.
72 5 (i. e.‚ a year after Franke's date for the publication of

the Epodes).

Parentis olim si quis impia manu
Senile guttur fregerit,

Edit cicutis allium nocentius.
O dura messorum ilia!

Quid hoc veneni saevit in praecordiis?
Num viperinus his cruor

Incoctus herbis me fefellit? an, malas
Canidia tractavit dapes?

Ut Argonautas praeter omnes candidum*
Medea mirata est ducem,

Ignota tauris illigaturum juga
Perunxit hoc Jasonem 3

Hoc delibutis ulta donis pellicem.
Serpente fugit alite.

struction which Orelli prohibits‚ but I like Orelli’s the best.
