for his uncle's murder is in becoming the protector and father
of his people. Against this praise it may be said, not without
reason, that· the poem has blemishes of a kind from which
Horace is free in odes of similar importance 3 that there is
something forced and· artificial in the kind of humour admitted
into the description of Pyrrha's fiood 3 that the idea of the
uxorious River bursting his banks out of complaisance to the
. complaints of his wife is little better than a frigid conceit 3 and
that the ‘⁶ extravaganza '² contained in the transfiguration of
Mercury into the earthly form of Augustus, fails in that man-
liness of genuine enthusiasm with which Horace celebrates
Augustus in Odes B. III. and IV. Whatever weight may be
attached to these objections, they suffice to render the ode
one of the most difficult to translate so as to impress an
’ English reader with some sense of the beauties ascribed to

it by its admirers.
CARM. II.

Jam satis terris nivis atque dirae

Grandinis misit Pater, et rubente

Dextera sacras jaculatus arces,7¹⁶
Terruit Urbem,

Terruit gentes, grave ne rediret

Omne cum Proteus pecus egit altos
Visere m“onte''s,‚

Piscium et summa ‘genus haesit ulmo,

Nota quae sedes fuerat columbis,

Et superjecto pavidae natarunt
AEquore'† damae.

poets applied it afterwards to the latter (Cicero, Acad. 2). Though the
word here implies “water,'’ the point would be lost in so translating
<it. There would be no prodigy in deer swimming through water-—
the prodigy is in their swimming through plains cast over those on
which they had been aecustomed to range. ·
