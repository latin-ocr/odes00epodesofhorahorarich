224 THE ODES OF HORACE.

High Caesar, seeking to conclude his labours,
Settling in peaceful towns war—wearied cohorts,⁹⁵
Ye solace and refresh
In the Pierian grotto's placid shade.

Ye are the natural givers of mild counsel,
Your joy to give it, ye yourselves so gentle Σ †
’.δί We know how He, whose law
Tempers the sluggish earth and windy sea,

He who, the Sole One, rules with tranquil justice

The 'stablished states—-the varying crowd of mortals‚
Gods, and the Ghastly Realms—
Smote with prone bolt the Titans’ impious crew,

And banded giants towering into battle :
That horrid youth in strength of arm confiding—
Brethren who sought to pile
Pelion on dun Olympus, and to Jove

⁴* “ Militia simul
Fessas cohortes addidit oppidis.”

The MSS. vary in the reading—“addidit‚'' “abdidit‚'’ and “reddidit.’‘
Dillenburger prefers “abdidit,’' which the scholiasts explain as being
sent to winter quarters. Orelli powerfully contends for “ addidit,’' as
significant of new towns or colonies, in favour of which he cites Tacitus,
Ann. xiii. 31, “ Coloniae Capua atque Nuceria additis veteranis firmatae
sunt.'’ After the conquest of the Salassi, a people of the Gaulish Alps
(A. U. C. 729), Augustus assigned their territory to the Praetorian troops,
who built Augusta Praetoria (Aosta). To other troops were assigned
lands in Lusitania, Augusta Emerita (Merida). Macleane agrees with
Orelli. The true reading being, however, uncertain, I have left it
equally vague in the translation. I may observe‚ however, that as
Macleane, in common with other eminent commentatorS, considers this
ode written between A. U. C. 725 and 728, the line cannot refer to the
new towns in the territory taken from the Salassi, A.U.C. 729.

Gaudetis, almae.'’
