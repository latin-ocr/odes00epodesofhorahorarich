280 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XVII.
To L. AELms LAMIA.

,This personage was the son of the L. AE. Lamia who sup-
ported Cicero in the suppression of the Catiline conspiracy,
and appears during the civil wars to have espoused the party
of Caesar. Horace's friend was consul A.D. 35 afterwards
appointed by Tiberius governor of Syria, but not allowed to
enter on the administration of the province. He became,

A.D.

Noble AElius, whose house hath its rise in that Lamus
From whom both the first and the later descendants
(As attesting memorial&⁶ record)
The great name of Lamia inherit,

Thou canst trace back, indeed, to an absolute monarch,

Holding sway, it is said, over Formia's walled ramparts,
And the waters of Liris, that flow
Into grassy domains of Marica.

To-morrow the east wind shall send us a tempest,
Which—if true be the crow, that old seer of foul weather—
Shall strew in the grove many leave53
On the shore,† many profitless sea-weeds.

While thou canst, then, protect from the rains the dry
saggots ;
Spend to-morrow in resting thyself and thy household 3
Feast thy genius with wine—but not mixed ;
And do not forget a young porker.

ἦ· The shore of Minturna, on the borders of Latium and Campania; ’
where the nymph Marica was worshipped.
