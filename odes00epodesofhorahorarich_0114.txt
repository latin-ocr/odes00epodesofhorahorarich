66 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Here, within the deep vale, thou shalt shun the red dog-star,
An'd shalt sing us that tale on the lute-strings of TeOS, ·
How Penelope vied with the Sea's
Crystal Circe, for one human heart3 ,

Safely here shalt thou quaff, under cool leafy shadows,
Sober cups from the innocent vineyards of Lesbos 3
’Tis not here that gay Semele’s son ἃ
Shall with Mars his encounters confound 3

Dread not here lest pert Cyrus, suspecting thee vilely,
Lay rash hands on that form not a match for rude anger,
Rend the garland which clings to thy hair,
Or the robe—which deserves no such wrong.

ἃ Bacchus.
