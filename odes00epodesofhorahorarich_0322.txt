274 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XV.

ΟΝ AN OLD WOMAN AFFECTING YOUTH.

The names in this poem are, of course, fictitious, and the
satire itself is of very general application even in the pre-
sent day. Its date is undiscoverable.

Mend thy life--it is time 3 cease such pains to be vile,
Flaunting wife of the indigent Ibycus 3

Fitter far for the grave, do not gambol with girls,
Interspersing a cloud ’mid the galaxy.

That which Pholoe thy daughter may suit well enough,
In thee, hoary Chloris, is horrible ε*

'Tis permitted to her to besiege the young rakes
In their homes, with much greater propriety:

No Bacchante the timbrel excites with its clash,
Than that daughter of ‘chine can be livelier;

And now that with Nothus she's fallen in love,
Not a roe on the hills is more frolicsome.

What becomes thee the best is a warm woollen dress ;
Get thee fleeces from famous Luceria 3†

What become thee the least are the lute and the rose,
And the cask tippled dry with young rioters.

'¹' “ Anus cum ludit, Morti delicias facit.''-—P. SYRUS.
Ἰ· Α town in Apulia now called Lucera. In its neighbourhood was
oneof the largest tracts of public pasture-land. The wools of Luceria

were celebrated.
