156 · THE omis OF HORACE.

ODE IX.
To c. VALGms RUFUS.

( In C onsolation.)

This Valgius, of consular rank, appears to have been
much esteemed in his time as a poet. He wrote elegies and
epigrams, and had even a high claim to the pretensions of
an epic poet, according to the author of the ‘Panegyric
on Messala '—

“ Est tibi, qui posset magnis se accingere rebus,
Valgius, aeterno propior non alter Homero.’'

Horace might therefore well call upon him to lay aside his

elegiae complaints and sing the triumphs of Augustus He

'Tis not always the fields are made rough by the rains,

’Tis not always the Caspian is harried by storm 3

Neither is it each month in the year
That the ice stands inert on the shores of Armenia 3

Nor on lofty Garganus the loud-groaning oaks
Wrestle, rocked to and fro 'with the blasts of the north,
Nor the ash-tree's droop widowed of leaves.
O my friend, O my Valgius, shall grief last for ever?

Yet thy heart in its yearning for ever pursues
The loved and lost Mystes 3 the star of the eve,
And the sunrise which chases the star,
Find thy love still lamenting the loss of thy Mystes.

But'the old man, who three generations lived through,
Did not for Antilochus mourn all his years ι
Nor for Troilus, nipped in his bloom,
Flowed for ever the tears of his parents and sisters,
