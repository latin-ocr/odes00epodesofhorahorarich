290 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Chasing 'care from* the brows'of the wise,
Thou unlockest their hearts to Lyaeus*

Hope and nerve thou restorest to minds worn and harassed,
Add'st the horn that exalts to the front of the beggar 3
Fresh from thee he could face down a king,
Fresh from thee, brave the charge of an army.

Thee, shall Liber and Venus, if Venus come merry,
And the Graces, reluctant their bond to dissever‚
And the living lights gaily prolong‚
Till the stars fly from Phoebus returning.

θ’ “ Retegis Lyaeo.’' “ The dative case, ‘ to’ Lyaeus, appears here to
be employed rather than the ablative.’'—ORELL1.
