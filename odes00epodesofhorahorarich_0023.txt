INTRODUCTION. xix

that on the fatal field of Philippi, when those who most
vaunted their valour fied in panic or bit the dust, he too
had left his shield not too valiantly behind him 3 he who, in
the same poem, addressed to a brother soldier, tells us that
he had gone through the worst extremities in that bloody
war. For those panegyrics on Augustus which, in our
young days, we regarded as renegade flattery bestowed upon
a man who had destroyed the political liberties for which the
poet had fought, we accept the rational excuses which are

sympathising friend. What has passed in our own time in
France renders more clear to us the general state of feeling
in Rome. When the population have once tested the
security of established order, and, with terrified remem-
brance of the bloodshed and. havoc of a previous anarchy‚
