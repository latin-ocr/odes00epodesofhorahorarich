72 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE ΧΙὶέ

ΤΟ GLYCERA.

Whether Glycera and Cinara be the same person—whe-
ther the Glycera here addressed be the same Glycera as is
elsewhere

Methought I had finished with love
When the mother herself of the Cupids, merciless mother
she is,
And the Theban boy, Semele’s son,
And the goddess called Wantonness bade me to love again
render my soul.

It burns me that smoothness of light,
Than the marble of Paros more pure, which is shed over
Glycera's face——
It burns me that dear saucy charm,
And the look slippery-sheen to behold : he who loiters and
· gazes must fall.

All Venus has rushed upon me,
Deserting her temples in Cyprus, She will not pemiit me
to sm
Of the Scyffh, and the seints of the steeds
Which the Parthians wheel round on the foe, nor of aught
which belongs not to love.

Hither, slaves, quick! an altar in haste-
Pile it up with the green living sod3 hither vervain and
frankincense bring,
And wine winters two have matured :
By the blood of a victim appeased‚ more gently the goddess
may come.
