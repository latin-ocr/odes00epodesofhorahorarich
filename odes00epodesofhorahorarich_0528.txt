480 THE EPoDEs OF HORACE.

O thou warehouse of venomous fuel from Colchis,—
Till I’m whirled, a parched cinder, the waif of the winds?
What the death that awaits or the fine that redeems me ? ι
Every penalty asked Ι will honestly pay:
Speak Ι a hundred young steers 3 or a couple of stanzas
To be sung to a lute-string attuned to a lie,

'l‘ “obsoleta” This word, as Macleane observes, is applied in an
unusual sense. It usually signifies “ that which is gone to decay,” ‘⁶ out
of use ; ’' and so it eomes to mean that which is spoilt and worthless (in
which sense Macleane implies that he would take it here). Orelli, I
think, better explains it as ‘⁶ inquinata,” “ deformata.’' Ι apprehend that
