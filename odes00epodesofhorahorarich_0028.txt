xxiv THE ODEs OF HORACE.

great form of Regulus urging the Senate to refuse to
ransom the Roman captives taken by Carthage-places
him as on a visible stage—utters his language, describes his
looks, and shows him departing to face the tormentors,
satisfied and serene. Would he console a girl for the ab-
sence of her lover, and hint to herself a friendly caution
against an insidious gallant? In eight short stanzas he con-
denses a whole drama in personages and plot. Does he paint
the reconciliation of two jealous lovers? ’ He makes them
speak for themselves 3 and their brief dialogue is among the

Thus he begins a poem by an invocation to Mercury and
the lyre to teach him a strain that may soften the coy heart of

the phantoms in the shades below3 the Danaides rest their
urn, and then, as if the image of the Danaides spontaneously
and suddenly suggested the idea, he places on the scene the
sister murderesses at night slaughtering their bridegrooms—
and the image of Hypermnestra, the sole gentle and tendet
one, waking her lord and urging him to fly.
