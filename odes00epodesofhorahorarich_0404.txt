356 THE ODES OF HORACE.

O thou Pierian Muse,

That tun'st the sweet clash of the golden shell 3
Thou who, if such thy will,

Couldst make mute fishes musical as swans,

Thine ls the boon, all thine,
That Ι am singled from the passers- -by
“Lyrist of Roman song. ¹'' —
Thine that I breathe and please, if please I may.⁹⁵

 

 

 

ἃ “Quod spiro,'' “that I breathe the breath of song''—“quod
movet me spiritus poeticus.’'—-D1LLENBU RGER, ORELL1‚ RITTER.
