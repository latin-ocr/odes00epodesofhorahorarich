BOOK 1.—ODE XXXVII. 121

for the foe who defrauds the victor of his triumph, and dies
a queen, that very generosity of his serves more to justify
the joyous exultation with which the poem commences,
since it implies the determined nature of the great enemy
from whom Rome is delivered. The date of the poem is
sufficiently clear. M. Tullius Cicero, son of the orator,
brought to Rome the news of the taking of Alexandria, and
the deaths ofAntony and Cleopatra, Sept, A.U.c. 724, suggest-
ing this exhortation to private and public rejoicings. It will
be observed here, as elsewhere, how Horace avoids naming
Mark Antony. Two lines from a fragment of Alcaeus are

cited by Commentators to show that the commencement of
this ode is imitated from them. They rather serve to show
with what sedulous avoidance of servility Horace does
imitate, and how thoroughly Roman the whole treatment
of his poem is, whatever be the lines to which a Greek
poem may furnish hint and suggestion.

CARM. XXXVII. l

Nunc est bibendum, nunc pede libero
Pulsanda tellus 3 nunc Saliaribus*
Ornare pulvinar deorum
’ Tempus erat dapibuS‚ sodales.

Antehac nefas depromere Caecubum
Cellis avitis, dum Capitolio
Regina dementes ruinas, ’
Funus et imperio parabat

Contaminato cum grege turpium
Morbo virorum, quidlibet impotens
Sperare, fortunaque dulci
Ebria. Sed minuit furorem
