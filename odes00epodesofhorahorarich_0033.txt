INTRODUCTION. xxix

it is only the eye of a native that can detect it—their truth-
fulness to nature so limited to a circumscribed range of
mind, that, even in England‚ neither the mirthful nor the
melancholy man, unless he be a poet or a student, recog-
nises in either poem his own favourite tastes and pleasureS.
But where Horace describes men’s pleasures‚ every man
finds something of himself 3 the familiar kindliness of ⁴his
language impresses its poetry upon those who have no pre-
tension to be poets. Had Horace written with equal length
and with equal care an ‘Allegro' and a ‘Penseroso,' not
only the poet and the student, not only the man of senti-
ment and reflection‚ but all varieties in our common family
—the young lover, the ambitious schemer‚ the man of plea—
sure, the country yeoman, the city clerk, even the rural
labourer—would have found lines in which he saw himself
as in a mirror.

Thus, then, Horace’s exquisite felicity of wording is for
the most part free from any sustained attempt at a language
essentially distinct from that of conversation3 and for that
very reason its beauties of poetical expression both please
and strike the more, because they have more the air of those
spontaneous flashes of genius which delight us in a great
orator or a brilliant talker.

I cannot pass by without comment a characteristic of
Horace's “form'’ in lyrical poetry, which is too striking to
esffiffiy critic ; but no critic has
attempted satisfactorily to define the principles of art to
which its peculiar fascination may be traced. It is in the
choice of epithets derived from proper names, or rather the
names of places, by which ‘⁴ generals '’ are individualised

into “particulam'' The sea is nm general—it is

 

and I may add Byron, being as well appreciated on the Continent as
any Latin author is ; and Ι doubt whether even in England there be as
many readers of poetry familiar with ‘ L'Allegro ’ and ‘ Il Penseroso ’ as
there are with the Odes of Horace.
