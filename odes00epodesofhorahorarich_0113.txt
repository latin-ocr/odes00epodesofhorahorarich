BOOK 1.-—ODE xvn. 65

the reference to the jealous violence of Cyrus looks like an
allusion to some incident that had previously occurred. On
the one hand, nothing is more likely than that Horace
should have known, and invited to his villa, some such ac-
complished freed-woman as is here addressed. On the
other hand, nothing is more consonant to his exquisite art
than the invention of attributes and incidents for the pur-
pose of giving the interest of reality to a purely imaginary
creation. . A compliment to the beauty of the person ad-
dressed is insinuated by the name of Tyndaris, “as if‚” says
’ Orelli, “ she were another Helen.’'
