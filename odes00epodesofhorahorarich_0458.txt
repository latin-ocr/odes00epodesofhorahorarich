410 THE ODEs OF? HORACE.

Virtues from which have grown the Roman name,
Italia’ s might, ffame and majestic sway,
To the Sun' s Orient rise,
From his calm bed' 1n our Hesperian seas, ⁴

Caesar our guardian, neither civil rage ³⁵
Nor felon violence scares us from repose,
Nor ire which sharpens swords,
And makes the wars of nations and their woeS.

Neither the drinkers of deep Danube break
The Julian Laws, nor Scyths, nor Seres fierce,
Nor Persia's faithless sons,
Nor wild men cradled on the banks of Don.

So, with each sacred, with each common day
(Prayer, as is due, first rendered to the gods),

'Mid blithesome Liber's boons,
Gathering our women and our children round,

Let us, as did our fathers in old time,
Honour with hymns and Lydian fife brave chiefs ε
Sing Troy 3 Anchises sing3
Sing of the race from gentle Venus sprung.

ἃ “ N 011 furor
Civilis aut vis exiget otium,
Non ira, quae procudit enses,
Et miseras inimicat urbes. ’⁷
Three causes of fear are removed: “ Furor civilis,'’ ‘⁶ civil war ;’' “ vis,''
‘⁶ personal violence ;'' “ira‚'’ “ foreign wars.”
