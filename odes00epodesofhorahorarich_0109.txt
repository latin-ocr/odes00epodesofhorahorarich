BOOK 1.-ODE XVI. 61

titiouS. Horace, no doubt, in his youth wrote a great
many satirica] or vituperative poems which he had too
good taste to republish, and which, happily for his fame,
have perished altogether. To some lady so libelled we
may well suppose this ode to have been addressed, for it
has an air of reality about it. It may have been suggested
by the poem in which Stesichorus recanted his slanders on
. Helen, bu't to what extent Horace here imitates that poem,
there are no means of judging.

O matre pulchra filia pulchrior,
Quem criminosis ‘cunque voles modum
Ponis iambis, sive flamma

Sive mari libet Hadriano.

No'n Dindymene, non adytis qut
Mentem sacerdotum incola Pythius,
Non Liber aeque, n0n acuta
Sic geminant Corybantes aera,

Tristes ut irae, quas neque Noricus
Deterret ensis, nec mare naufragum,
Nec saevus ignis, nec tremendo
Juppiter ipse ruens tumultu.
