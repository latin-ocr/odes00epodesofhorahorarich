A.D. 32, “Praefectus Urbi‚'’ and died the following year.
Mitscherlich says: “ His own good sense will easily show
any well-bred gentleman (urbanum) that Horace phere, in a
well-bred‚ gentlemanlike way, offers himself as a guest, in
plain words, hints that Lamia should ask him to dine.’' On ¹
which the commentator in Orelli observes, with much feel-
ing asperity: “ In the whole poem there is not a vestige of
this sort of gentlemanlike goodbreeding, if gentlemanlike
good-breeding it be, which it is permitted vehemently to
doubt.'’ Evidently the commentator is an Italian. A gen-
tleman of that country would certainly dispute the good-
breeding of any friend offering to drop in at dinner.

CARM. XVII.

AEli, vetusto nobilis ab Lamo,
Quando et priores hinc Lamias ferunt
Denominatos, et nepotum
Per memores genus omne fastos 3⁹⁵

Auctore ab illo ducis originem,

Qui Formiarum moenia dicitur
Princeps et innantem Maricae

Litoribus tenuisse Lirim,†

Late tyrannus: cras foliis nemus
Multis et alga litus inutili
Demissa tempestas ab Euro
Sternet, aquae nisi fallit augur

Annosa cornix. Dum potis, aridum
Compone lignum : cras Genium mero
Curabis et porco bimestri,
Cum famulis operum solutis.
