50 THE ODES OF HORACE.

O D E XIII.

TO LYDIA.

In this ode is expressed naturally enough the sort of jeal·
ousy which a Lydia would be likely to inspire in a general
lover, such as Horace represents himself in his poems——“sive

quid urimur non praeter solitum leveS.'' The ode in

When thou the rosy neck of Telephus, 1tse1f,

The waxen arms of Telephus, art praising,
Woe is me, Lydia, how my jealous heart
Swells with the anguish I would vainly smother.

Then in my mind thought has no settled base,
To and fro shifts upon my cheek the colour,
And tears that glide adown in stealth reveal
By what slow fires mine inmost self consumeth.

Ι burn, or whether quarrel o’er his wine,

Stain with a bruise dishonouring thy white shoulders,
Or whether my boy-rival on thy lips

Leave by a scar the mark of his rude kisses.

Hope not, if thou wouldst hearken unto me,
That one so little kind prove always constant 3

Barbarous indeed to wound sweet lips imbued
By Venus with a fifth part of her nectar.9⁶

Thrice happy, ay more than thrice happy, they
Whom one soft bond unbroken binds together,

Whose love serene from bickering and reproach
In life's last moment finds the first that severs.

ἥ “ Quinta parte sui nectaris.’' It has been disputed whether Horace
means by this expression the Pythagorean quintessenee‚ which is ether.
Most modern translators so take it—-‘ ‘ an interpretation, '' says Maeleane‚
“which I am surprised to find Orelli adopts with others, that does not
commend itself to my mind at all.'' Neither does it to mine. 1
