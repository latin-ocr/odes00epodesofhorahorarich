BOOK 1.—oDE 1. '5

in modern England, high office and vast wealth, more than
aught else, raised men to the sky.’'

For the three odes in this measure I have employed in
translation a metre consisting of our ordinary form of blank
verse converted into a couplet by alternate terminations in
a dissyllable and monosyllable 3 and though that is a very
simple, and may seem at first a very slight, modification of a
familiar rhythm, it will be found to constitute, in the regular
recurrence of alternated terminals, a marked difference from
the chime of our epic line, and is yet equally in unison with
the laws of our prosody. I have adopted the same metre in
my version of the more important epodes, and in a few of
the other odes.

founds it by synecdoche), and was used as a hoe for digging up weeds.
The author of the article on “Agriculture” in Smith's ‘ Dictionary of

, Greek and Roman Antiquities’ says that “it was an implement by which,

after covering up the seed, the husbandman loosened the roots of the
young blades in order that air and moisture might gain free access.’'
