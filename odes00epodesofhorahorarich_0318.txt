270 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XIV.

“Composed at the close of the Cantabrian war, A.U.C.
729, when Augustus’s return was expected, or on his return
the following year.''—-MACLEANE.

In noticing the critical animadversions on this ode “as

unequal
Joy, O ye people Ξ it was said that Caesar

Went forth like Hercules, in quest of laurels
Bought but by death3 now home from shores Hispanian
Comes he back victor.

Let her whose joy in her sole lord is centred ‘³⁶

Join, in thanksgivings due, the glad procession—

Join with the sister of our glorious chieftain*
Join with the mothers,

Chastely adorned by sacrificial fillets †-—

Mothers of children now no more imperilled 3

Youths and young brides hush, at such time ill-omened,
Each lighter whisper.

Truly to me this holiday is sacred,

And its bright sunshine chases cloudy troubles.

I sear nor open brawl nor stealthy murder,‡
Caesar yet living!

Up, boy, and bring the perfume and the garlands,

And wine that to the Marsian war bears witness,

If one jar, baffling Spartacus the Rover,
Somewhere lurks hidden.§

ἃ “ Unico gaudens mulier marit0.” See Orelli’s note on “unieo,”
which some have interpreted in the sense of “ unique ’' or “peerless ;’'
Dillenburger, as “dear” or “beloved.’'

Τ Worn by the Roman matrons to distinguish them from freed women.

‡ ‘⁴ Nec tumultum, ·
N ec mori per vim metuam.'' Α
“Tumultum'' here evidently means “intestine feud '’ or “popular out· ·
break ;” ‘⁴ vim,” “assassination” or “ personal violence.” With Caesar
is identified the prevailing security of law.
