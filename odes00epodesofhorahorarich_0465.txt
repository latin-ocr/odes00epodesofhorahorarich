p. 199, and subsequently in Smith’s ‘Biographical Diction-
ary’ (art. “ Maecenas ’'), contends that the poem refers to the
Sicilian expedition against Sextus Pompeius, A. U. C. 718.
Macleane objects to this supposition—-“ that the language
of affection is too strong for the short acquaintance which
Horace had then enjoyed with Maecenas, and that there is
evidence in the poem itself of the Sabine farm having corne
into Horace's possession when he wrote it3 but that this
did not occur till after the publication of the First Book of
Satires is certain, and it is generally referred to A.U.C. 720.”

CARM. Ι.

Ibis Liburnis inter alta navium,
Amice, propugnacula,

Paratus omne Caesaris periculum
Subire, Maecenas, tuo.

Quid nOS, quibus te vita si superstite
Jucunda, si contra, gravis Ρ

Utrumne jussi persequemur otium,
Non dulce, ni tecum simul,

An hunc laborem mente laturi, decet
Qua ferre non molles viros? >

Feremus 3 et te vel per Alpium Juga
Inhospitalem et Caucasum,

Vel Occidentis usque ad ultimum sinum
Forti sequemur pectore.

Roges, tuum labore quid juvem meo,
Imbellis ac firmus parum?
Comes minore sum futurus in metu,
Qui major absentes habet 3
Ut assidens implumibus pullis avis
⁵ Serpentium allapsus timet
