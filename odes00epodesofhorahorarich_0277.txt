and though there are sufficient instances of variation of
quantity in proper names—such as Priamus, PriamideS,
Sicanus, Sicania, Italus, <Sco—yet it is thought improbable
that in so elaborate a poem Horace would have varied the
quantity in two consecutive lines. Passing by the proso-
diacal objection, a graver difficulty has been found in the
construction, “ Me in Apulian Vultur beyond the threshold
of my nurse Apulia,'' The Apennine range, still called

And Horace, Satire ii. 1, says it is doubtful whether he was

birthplace) ploughed the boundaries of both these provinces,
Had he said “ Lucanian Vultur,’' “ beyond the threshold of
Apulia,’' the passage, therefore, would have been clear 3 but
