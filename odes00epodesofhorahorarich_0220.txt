172 THE ODES OF HORACE.

But the death most to sear is the death we least look for—
Ah 1 how near was I seeing dark Proserpine’s kingdom,

And the Judge of the Dead and the Seats of the Blest‚
Sappho wailing melodious of· loves unretumed 3 ³⁵

Ay, and thee, too, with strains sounding larger, Alcaeus,
To thy golden shell chanting of hardships in shipwreck,
And of hardships in exile, and hardships in war,
While the Shadows admiringly hearken to both 3

Due to either is silence as hushed as in temples‚
But more presses the phantom mob, shoulder on shoulder,
Drinking into rapt ears the grand song, when it swells
With the burthen of battles and tyrants o’erthrown.

What wonder? since, spelled by the voice of the charmer,
The dark hell-dog his hundred heads fawningly croucheS,
And the serpents that writhe interweaved in the looks

Of the Furies‚ repose upon terrible brows 3

And Prometheus himself and the Father of PelopS‚

By the dulcet delight are beguiled from their torture,
While the hand of Orion the arrow lets fall,

And the spectres of lions unheeded flit on.
