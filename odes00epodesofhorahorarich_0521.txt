EPODE XVI. 473

Aut pars indocili melior grege 3 mollis et exspes
Inominata perprimat cubilia!

Vos, quibus est virtus, muliebrem tollite luctum,
Etrusca praeter et volate litora.

Nos manet Oceanus circumvagus ε arva, beata
Petamus arva divites et insulas 3

Reddit ubi Cererem tellus inarata quotannis,
Et imputata floret usque vinea,

Germinat et nunquam fallentis termes olivae, †
Suamque pulla ficus ornat arborem,

Mella cava manant ex ilice, montibus altis
Levis crepante lympha desilit pede.

Illic injussae veniunt ad mulctra capellae,
Refertque tenta grex amicus ubera 3

Nec vespertinus circumgemit ursus ovile,‡
Neque intumescit alta viperis humuS.§

Pluraque felices mirabimur: ut neque largis
Aquosus Eurus arva radat imbribus, ΙΙ

interpretation, Orelli commends Jahn's proposed construction to take
“alta”,with “intumescit ’'—“swells high.'' Macleane indorses it.
Orelli refers “tumescit '' not to the sweltering venom, but to the
undulous movement of the reptile, alternately rising and falling, so
that the ground literally seems to heave, as the commentator in Orelli
says he has himself noticed‚ in his solitary walks along the meadows
and water-banks of Italy, which, but for the vipers‚ would have been
exceedingly pleasant. In the translation it -is sought to render this
idea, drawn from th'e critic's personal observation‚ and which, as a
friend suggests, is in curious accordance with a passage in Humboldt's
‘Aspects of Nature,' where he describes the reptiles, snakes, breaking
their way through the clay soil left by the inundations of the Orinoco,
and lifting the ground into little heaps. Ritter finds fault with Orel-
li's interpretation, and contends that “ alta ” denotes the high grass and
herbage of the soil.

ΙΙ “ Aquosus Eurus arva radat imbribus. The literal and vernaculai·
meaning of “rado '' is “to shave‚’' as “radere caput 3 '' “ radere lit-
tora” (generally construed “to coast along '’) is better interpreted by
the phrase familiar enough to our English sailor, “to shave the shore.”
Orelli here construes “ radat ’' “ deluges,'' or “lays waste.’'
