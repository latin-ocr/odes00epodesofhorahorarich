BOOK IV.—ODE XII. 397

N idum ponit, Ityn flebiliter gemenS‚

Infelix avis et Cecropiae domus

AEternum opprobrium, quod male barbaras
Regum est ultalibidines.⁹⁶

Dicunt in tenero gramine pinguium

Custodes ovium carmina fistula,

Delectantque deum, cui pecus et nigri
Colles Arcadiae placent.

Adduxere sitim tempora, Virgili 3

Sed pressum Calibus ducere Liberum

Si gestis, juvenum nobilium cliens,
Nardo vina merebere.

Nardi parvus onyx eliciet cadum,

Qui nunc Sulpiciis accubat horreisss⁶

Spes donare novas largm, amaraque
i Curarum eluere efficax.

Ad quae si properas gudia, cum tua

Velox merce veni : non ego te meis

Immunem meditor tingere poculis,
Plena dives ut in domo,

Verum pone moras et studium lucri,

Nigrorumque memor, dum licet, ignium,

Misce stultitiam consiliis brevem :
Dulce est desipere in loco.

’ † “Sulpiciis horreis.’' The Sulpician wine-vaults were famous, and

’ the scholiast Porphyrion says they were still the great magazines for

wine and oil iri his day, under the name of the Galban cellars. Ritter

considers that Orelli is mistaken in supposing that Horace intimates·
that he will buy the wine there3 and maintains that he refers to his own

cask, which had been warehoused in the Sulpician magazine.
