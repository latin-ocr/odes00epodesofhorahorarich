144 THE· ODES OF HORACE.

O'DE VI.
To SEPTIMms,

It is a reasonable conjecture, though nothing more, that
this is the same Septimius whom Horace introduces to
Tiberius, Ep. Ι. ix., and whom Augustus mentions in a letter
to Horace, preserved in the life attributed to Suetonius.
The scholiast in Cruquius says that he was a Roman knight,

and

To the world's end thou'dst go with me, Septimius,

View tribes Cantabriam, for our yoke too savage 5

And barbarous Syrtes, where the Moorish billow
Whirls, ever-seething3

No, my Septimius, may, mine age close calmly

In that mild Tibur by the Argive founded 3

There, tired of ranging lands and seas, and warfare,
Reach my last limit.

Or if such haven the hard F ates deny me,

Thee will I seek‚ Galaesus, gentle river,

Dear to flocks skin-clad 3⁴⁶² and thy rural kingdom,
Spartan Phalanthus.†

Out of all earth most smiles to me that corner,

Where the balmed honey yields not to Hymettus,

Where olives vie with those whose silvery verdure
Gladdens Venafrum 5

⁴* “ Pellitis ovibus.” “ Pellitis '' is supposed by Orelli and others to
refer to the hides with which the fleeces of the sheep were protected
from thorns and brambles and atmospheric changes.

† Tarentum, of which Phalanthus, the leader of the emigrant Par-
theniae, after the first Messenian war, got possession.
