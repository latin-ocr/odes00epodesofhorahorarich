166 THE omes OF HORACE.

ODE XII.
To MAECENAS.

The Licymnia (or, as the scholiasts spell it, Licinia) cele-
brated in this ode was most probably Terentia, the wife of
Maecenas 3 and if so, the poem was evidently written within
a few years after their marriage. It is not pleasant to think
that the wedded happiness so charmingly described was of
brief duration, and that the faults laid to the charge of the
lady embittered the life of Maecenas at its close. Some of

Ask no high-sounding themes from this lute's relaxed num-
bers,

Suited neither to strains of long wars with Numantia,

Nor of Hannibal dire, nor of waters Sicilian

Which Carthage made red with her blood ς

Nor of Lapithae fierce, and the great drunken Centaur 3

Nor of Earth’s giant sonS‚ overborne by Alcides,

Threat'ning perils that shook to its starry foundations
Old Saturn's refulgent abode.

And far better thy prose than my verse, O MaecenaS,
hall record, in grave story, the battles of Caesar,
And the necks of the kings who have loftily threatened
His Rome, to pass under her yoke.

Me the Muse has enjoined for the theme of my praiseS,

Thy lady Licymnia—her dulcet-voiced singings,

And the sunshine of eyes that illumine her beauty,
And the loving heart true to thine own.

Graced alike, whether joining at home in the dances,
Or contesting the palm in gay wit's playful skirmish,
Or amid holy sports on the feast-day of Dian,

With virgins entwining the arm.
