INTRODUCTION. xxxix

Horace, and more recently submitted to the public the
experiment of the metres employed in the ‘Lost Tales of
Miletus.’ I will not lengthen this preface by any definition
of the general rhythmical principles upon which, in my judg-
ment, lyrical measures that, taking the form of strophe or
stanza, dispense with rhyme, should be invented and framed.
Should any writer be tempted hereafter to repeat and im-
prove on my experiments, he will easily detect the laws I
have laid down for myself, and adopt, modify, or reject
them, according to his own idiosyncrasies of ear and taste.

So far as these translations are concerned, it will be seen
that I have shunned any attempt to transfer to our own
language the exact form of the original metres. I have
rather sought to construet measures in accordance with
the character of English prosody, akin to the prevalent spirit
of the original, and of compass sufficient to allow a general
adherence to the rule of translating line by line, or at least
strophe by strophe, without needless amplification on the
one hand, or harsh contractiori on the other.

With regard to the rhythmical form in which a sufficient
analogy with the Latin metre can be best obtained by the
English, there will always be a differehce of taste and
opinion. My own plan, when I originally commenced
these translations, was in the first instance to attempt a
close imitation of the ancient measure, the scansion being
of course (as in English or German hexameters and pen-
tameters) by accent, not quantity—and then to make such
modifications of fiow and cadence as seemed to me best
to harmonise the rhythm to the English ear, while preserving
as much as possible that which has been called “the type ’'
of the original. But as there are more ways than one by
which such modifications may attain the obJects required,
so it soon appeared to me best to vary the modifications
according as the prevalent spirit of the ode demanded
lively and sportive‚ or serious and dignified, expression.
