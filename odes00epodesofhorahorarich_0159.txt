told. Demaratus, one of the Bacchiadae of Corinth, flying
from his native city when Cypselus destroyed the power of
that aristocratic order, settled at Tarquinii, in Etruria, and
married an Etruscan wife. His son Lucumo succeeded to
his wealth, and married Tanaquil, of one of the noblest
families in Tarquinii, but being, as a stranger‚ excluded from
state offices, Lucumo, urged by his wife, resolved to remove
to Rome. Just as he and his procession reached the Janic-
ulum, within sight of Rome, an eagle seized his cap, soared
with it to a great height—“cum magno clangore''—and then
replaced it on his head. Tanaquil predicted to him the
highest honours from this omen, and Lucumo, who assumed
the name of Tarquinius Priscus, ultimately obtained the
Roman throne. Macleane, in referring to the legend, and
to the reference to Phraates, thinks it not probable that Ho- '
race meant to allude to both these historical facts together,
and is therefore inclined to suppose that he intended neither
one nor the other. His objection does not impress me.
Nothing is more probable than that Horace should exem-
plify the sudden act of fortune in the Parthian revolution
and render his allusion more lively by a metaphor borrowed
from a familiar Roman myth.

Parcus deorum cultor et infrequens,
Insanientis dum sapientiae ⁷
Consultus erro, nunc retrorsum
Vela dare, atque iterare cursus

Cogor relictos z namque Diespiter,
Igni corusco nubila dividens
Plerumque, per purum tonantes
Egit equos volucremque currum 3
