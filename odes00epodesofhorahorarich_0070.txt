22 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE V.

TO PYRRHA.

Ι cannot presume to attempt any rhymeless version of*
'this ode in juxtaposition with Milton’s famous translation,
which I therefore annex. “Any resemblance between the

⁴* The reader will observe that the first line is the only one in the
translation which ends with a dissyllable. Whether Milton makes this
variation of the rhythm he selects through oversight or intention, the
reader can conjecture for himself. Probably Milton regarded the two
first lines of each strophe simply as heroic blank verse, in which the
termination by a monosyllable or dissyllable is optional.

† ‘⁴ Grato, Pyrrha, sub antro.’‘ “ Some pleasant cave ’' appears
scarcely to give the sense of the original. “ Antrum ” means the grotto
attached to the houses of the luxurious, and in which was placed a statue
of Venus. Grottoes are still in use among the richer Italian-S, and it is not
some cave to which Horace alludes‚ but with a certain tenderness of re-
proach to tlze grotto in which Pyrrha had been accustomed to receive him.
