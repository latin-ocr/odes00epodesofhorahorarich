xviii THE ODEs OF HORACE.

It is, then, mainly to this large and many-sided nature in
the man himself that Horace owes his unrivalled popularity
—a popularity which has indeed both widened in its circle
and deepened in its degree in proportion to the increase of
modern civilisation. And as the popularity is thus so much
derived from the qualities in which the man establishes
friendly intimacy with all ranks of his species, so it is ac-
companied with that degree of personal affection which few
writers have the happiness to inspire. We give willing ear
to the praise of his merits, and feel a certain displeasure at
the criticisms which appear harshly to qualify and restrict
them 3 we are indulgent to his faults‚ and rejoice when the
diligent research and kindly enthusiasm of German scholars
redeem his good name from any aspersions that had been

quasi liberam venerem ardentissime sectarentur. N ee Libri iv. carm.

latam de pudicitia quum nemo amplius amorem in puerum palam cele-
brare ausus fuisset.’⁵-P. 524.
