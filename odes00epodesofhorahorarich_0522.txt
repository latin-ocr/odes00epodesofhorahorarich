474 THE EpobEs'·' oF‘⁴' HORACE.

Nor rich seeds¹ parch within the sweltering glebe. ἱ

Either extreme the King of Heaven has tempered.
Thither ne’er rowed the oar of Argonaut,

The impure Colchian never there had footing.
There Sidon's trader brought no lust of gain 3

No weary toil there anchored with Ulysses 3
Sickness is known not; on the tender lamb

No ray falls baneful from one star in heaven.
When Jove’s decree alloyed the golden age,

He kept these shores for one pure race secreted ;
For all beside the golden age grew brass

Till the last centuries hardened to the iron,
Whence to the pure in heart a glad escapess⁶

By favour of my prophet-strain is given.†

ᾗ “ Quorum'’ depends on . “fuga” —- flight from the iron ages.
“ Piis '² has the signification of “ pure from crime.'’

‘l‘ It has been supposed by some that the description of these happy
islands‚ and the idea of migrating thither, is taken from the account oi
the VVestern Islands, which almost tempted Sertorius to seek in them
a refuge from the cares of his life, and the harassment of unceasing
wars. This story, which is told by Plutarch in his life of Sertorius, is
said by Acron to have been given by Sallust. But the general tradi-
tion of a happy land separated from the rest of the world was popular
among the ancients from the earliest time, and Horace might have got
the notion from Hesiod or Pindar. The poem, however, would assume
a much deeper and more earnest character if we could suppose that
the passage in question has a symbolica] signification, and refers to the
isle of happy souls in which Achilles was wed to Helen. In that case
the latent meaning would apply to another world beyond this, and its
moral would be, “ Rather than submit to the ills and ignominy in store
for us, let us take our chance of those seats in Elysium reserved for the
pure.”
