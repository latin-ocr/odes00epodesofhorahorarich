328 THE onns OF HORAcE.

From mean estate exalted into greatness—
Where brawls9⁶ loud Aufidus with violent wave,
And arid† reigned o'er rustic subjects, Daunus—
Ι, in the lips of men a household name,
Shall have my record as the first who wedded
To Roman melodies AEolian song.
Take airs of state—the right is earned--and crown me,
Willing Melpomene, with Delphic bay.

³* “ Mantua Virgilio gaudet, Verona Catullo,
Pelignae dicar gloria gentis eg0.'' ’
—OV1D, Amores, iii. 15, 17.

† “ Pauper aquae Daunus,’' “ Daunus scant of water.” The epithet
is thus, by poetic licence, applied to the legendary king, which, in plain
prose, belongs to the country 116 ruled—z'.e.‚ the southern part of Apulia,
as the Aufidus flowed through the western.
