264 THE omis OF HORACE.

“ Let my sire load me with his barbarous setterS,

Wroth with the pitying love that spares a husband,
O'r ship me outlawed to N umidian deserts 1
Be it so 1 Hasten Ξ

“ Go wheresoe’er fleet foot or sail can bear thee 5
Blest be the auspice Ξ Night and Venus favour !
Go, but remember me, and this sad story

Carve on my tombstone !’' ⁹⁵

 

⁴* It is pleasant to think that the modern law of what is called
“ poetic justice,’' has a precedent in the final restoration of this young
lady to the arms of the husband she had so mercifully spared. Pro-
bably she was the ugly one of the family, and less likely, if she killed
one husband, to find another. Ovid's Epistle of Hypermnestra to
Lynceus, supposed to be written while imprisoned by her father, is much
indebted to Horace's lines. But perhaps both poets borrowedfrom a
common source which is lost to modern discoverers.
