406 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Thee the⁴monster-fraught ocean, which roars
Round the birthpl'ace remote of the Briton 3

Thee fierce Gallia, the land for which death has no terror,
Thee Iberia, the *stubborn‚ hear hushed and submissive 3
The Sygambri, exulting in gore,
With meek arms piled in trophy‚ adore thee.
