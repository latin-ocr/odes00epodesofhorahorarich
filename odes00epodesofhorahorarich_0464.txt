416 THE EPODES oF HORACE.

EPoDE 1. ’
ΤΟ MAECENAS.

This epode is generally supposed to have been composed
when Augustus had summoned the leading public men,
whether senators or equiteS, to meet him at Brundusium
prior to the expedition against Antony and Cleopatra which
resulted in the battle of Actium, A.U.C. 72 3. The poem war-
rants the assumption that Maecenas had been then appointed
to, or offered, a naval command 3 but it seems (Dio. 51, 3,
and Seneca, Ep. 114, 6) that Augustus decided on retaining

him
So thou wilt go with thy Libumian galleys,
Amongst, O friend, those giant floating towers 3
Prepared to share all perils braved by Caesar,
And ward them off, Maecenas, by thine own.v
But what of us, to whom, while thou survivest,
Life is a j0y 3—thee lost, a weary load?
Shall we, as bidden, take our ease contented?
Ease has no sweetness if not shared with thee 3
Or shall we bear our part in thy great labour
As fitting men of no unmanly mould ?
Yes, we would bear 3 and thee o'er Alpine summits,
Or through the wastes of guestless Caucasus,
Or where the last pale rim of the horizon
Fades on the farthest waters of the west,
Follow with soul undaunted. Dost thou ask me
How, weak in body, and unskilled in war,
¹ My toil could lighten thine? I should be present
With terrors less than those the absent know3
Even as the bird more dreads for her young nestlings‚
If for a moment left, the gliding snake 3
