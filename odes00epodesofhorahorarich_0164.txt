116 THE ooEs OF HORACE.

To arms some madding crowd
Rouse with the shout to which an empire falls.

Thee doth untamed Necessity for ever
Stalk fierce before 3-the ship nails and the wedges

Bearing in grasp of bronze,
Which lacks nor molten lead nor steadfast clamp.²¹²

But thee Hope follow5, and rare Faith, the white-robed,
True to thee, even when thou thyself art altered,

And from the homes of Power
Passest away, in mourning weedS, a foe 3

While the false herd, the parasite, the harlot,
Shrink back: their love is dried up with the wine-cask,

Their lips reject its lees 3
Their necks will halve no yoke that Sorrow draws.

Guard Caesar, seeking on earth's verge the Brit0n‚—
Guard Rome's young swarm of warriors on the wing,
Where they alight, to awe
The rebel East and Araby’s red sea.

Shame for the scars, the guilt, the blood of brothers l
What have we shunned—we, the hard Age of Iron?

What of crime left intact ? ,
What youthful hand has sear of heaven restrained?

Where stands an altar sacred from its rapine?
Dread goddeSS,-—steel made blunt in impious battles

On anvils new reforge 3
And turn its edge on Arab and on Scyth !

³* Most recent commentators of authority agree in rejecting the notion
of the commentator in Cmquius, adopted by earlier editors, that “uncus ’²
and “ plumbum ’' are used here as emblems of punishment and crime,
and consider them as emblems of tenacity and fixity of purpose. Mac·
leane observes that the metaphor of molten lead for strengthening build-
ings is employed by Euripides, ‘Androm.,' 267. Herder suggests that
the whole picture of Necessity and her attributes is taken from some pie·
ture in the temple of Fortune at Antium.
