302 THE ODES OF HORACE.

O were we penitent, indeed, for sins,⁹⁵

How we should haste to cast gemS‚ gauds, gold, useless
Save as the raw material of all ill,

The immoderatess riches grow, forsooth, and grow,
But ne’er in growing can attain completion 3

An unknown something, ever absent still,
Stints into want the unsufficing fortune.

serious for Cicero to make it a grave charge against· M. Antony that he
had pardoned a man condemned for gambling, as he was himself a
habitual gambler. Juvenal says that the heir still in his infancy (bullatus)
learnt the dice -from his father.

‡ “ Improbae divitiae.'' “ Improbae ’¹ has not here the sense of “ dis-
honest’' or “ iniquitous,’' as it is commonly translated 3 it means, rather,
