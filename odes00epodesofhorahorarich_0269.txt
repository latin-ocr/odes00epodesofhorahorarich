BOOK III.--ODE IV. 221

begins by an invocation to Calliope, intimating his ambition
to accomplish a majestic or sustained poem without reveal-
ing its purport 3 passes on to the lovely stanzas descriptive
of his own devotion to poetry from childhood 3 links this
description with inimitable subtlety of touch to Augustus’s
culture of the humanising arts (v. 37, “Vos Caesarem‚”
&C.) 3 implies the union of such literary tastes with the
policy of peace (“ militia simul F essas cohortes addidit
oppidis‚’' &c.)‚ and with conciliatory and clement disposi-
tions (“ lene consilium‚⁷' &c). 3 and then, with a lyrical sud-
denness, bursts into the theme for which he had invoked
the muse at the commencement,—-“ Scimus ut impios ;’'
insinuafing, in the myth of the victory obtained over brute
force by the gods that represent wisdom (Pallas), industry
(Vulcan), social and domestic order (Juno), the ennobling
arts (Apollo), not only the victory of Augustus, but the
social and civilising influences to which the victory is
ascribed, and by which it is lastingly maintained.

CARM. IV.

Descende cae'lo, et dic age tibia
Regina longum Calliope melos?⁵
Seu vocemunc mavis acuta,
Seu fidibus citharaque Phoebi.

Auditis, an me ludit amabilis
Insania? Audire et videor pios
Errare per lucos, amoenae
Quos et aquae subeunt et aurae.

Me fabulosae Volture in Apulo
Altricis extra limen Apuliae †
Ludo fatigatumque somno
Fronde nova puerum palumbes

it, with Orelli, as a mode of saying ‘⁴ Come, and leave me not hastily or

soon. '⁹
