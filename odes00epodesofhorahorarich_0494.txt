446 THE EPODES OF HORACE.

EPODE VI.

AGAINST CASSIUS.

It is by no means clear who is the unlucky object of
these verses. Acron says he was a satirical poet of the
name of Cassius, upon the strength of which the scholiast
in Cruquius assumes him to have been the not uncelebrated
orator Cassius Severus, who was banished by Augustus, and
died in poverty and exile about sixty-three years after the

date

Why snap at the guests who do nobody harm,
Turning tail at the sight of a wolf?

O cur 1 thy vain threats why not venture on me,
Who can give back a bite for a bite? ,

Like mastiff Molossian or Sparta's dun hound, ,
Kindly friend to the shepherd am Ι 3

But I prick up my ears, and away through the snows,
If a wild beast of prey run before 3

But thou, if thou fillest the woods with thy bark,
Art struck dumb at the sniff of a bone.

Ah, beware l Ι am rough when Ι come upon knaves,
Ah, beware of a toss from my horns 1

I'm as sharp as the wit whom Lycambes deceived,
Or the bitter foe Bupalus roused 3 ἦ

Dost thou think, when a cur shows the grin of his teeth‚
That I’ll weep, unavenged, like a child?

ἃ Archilochus, to whom Lycambes refused his daughter Neobule‚
after having first promised her to him. The poet avenged himself in
verses so stinging‚ that Lycambes is said to have hanged himself. Bu-
palus was a sculptor, who, with his brother artist Athenis, ridiculed or
caricatured the uncomely features of Hipponem, and his verses are said

(though not truly) to have had the same fatal effect on the sculptor that
those of Archilochus had upon Lycambes.
