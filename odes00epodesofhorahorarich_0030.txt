xxvi THE ODEs OF HORACE.

elements to which the critics of a former age objected in
Shakespeare, than perhaps any poet extant except Shake-
speare himself. The consideration of this admirably artistic
fidelity to the mingled yarn of life, leads us on to the notice
of Horatian style and diction.

s The character of the audience he more immediately ad-
dresses will naturally have a certain effect on the style of an

author, and an effect great in proportion to his practical

good sense and good taste. No*w man 0055055001οῑ what

the French call savqg'gj zzvre, employs exactly the same style

even in extempore discourse, whether he address a select -

audience of scholars or a miscellaneous popular assembly.
The readers for whom Horace more immediately wrote were
the polite and intellectual circles of Rome, wherein a large
proportion were too busy, and a large proportion too idle,
to allow themselves to be diverted very far, or for long at
a stretch‚ into poetic regions, whether of thought or diction,
remote from their ordinary topics and habitual language.
Horace does not, therefore, in the larger number of songs
composed—some to be popularly sung and all to be popu-
larly read—build up a poetic language distinct from that of
conversation. On the contrary, with some striking excep-
tions, where the occasion is unusually solemn, he starts from
