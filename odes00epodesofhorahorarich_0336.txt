288 THE onEs OF HORACE.

ODE XXI.

TO MY CASK.

This poem appears composed in honour of some occasion
in which Horace entertained the famous L. Valerius Mes·
sala Corvinus. No man in that great age was more re-
markable for the variety of his accomplishments than this
Corvinus. Sprung from one of the greatest consular fami-
lies, he espoused the senatorian party in the civil wars, and
attached himself especially to Cassius. He held the third
place in the command of the Republican army, and at

Philippi
Coeval with me, born when Manlius was consul,
Whatsoe’er the effects of thy life, while in action—
Spleen or mirth, angry brawl or wild love,
Or, O gentle caskffi ready slumber—

Under what head soe’er there be entered account of 'r
The grapes thou hast kept since in Massicus gathered,
Thou art worth being roused on a day
Of good fortune 3 descendss for Corvinus

Asking wines by age mellowed 1 He will not neglect thee,
k All imbued though he be with Socratical maxims.
Father Cato, full often, ’tis said,

Warmed his virtue with wine undiluted.§

Thou givest a soft-pricking spur to the sluggish,
Makest gentle the harsh, and confiding the cautious.

‘¹‘ “ Pia testa.’' The exact meaning of “ pia’' here has given rise to
much critical disputation. Macleane says he knows no better transla-
tion than Francis’s “gentle cask‚'’ for the meaning is to be derived
from its connection with “facilem somnum.'' Yonge adopts the same
interpretation, “gentle‚ kindly,’'-observing “it would be ‘impia' if
producing ‘ querelas, rixas,'” ἃς. Ι have translated “testa’' cask, as

a word familiar to the English reader, but it here properly means the Α

amphora, a vessel into which the wine waS, as we should say, bottled.
