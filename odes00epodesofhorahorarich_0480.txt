432 THE EPODES‘ OF HORACE.

In public shows, despite the law of Otho,⁹⁶
He takes a foremost place and sits—a knight.
What boots the equipment of yon floating bulwarks,
Yon vast array of ponderous brazen prores?
What 1 against slaves and pirates launch an army,†
Which has for officer,—that man—that man 1”

 

⁴⁶ F ourteen rows in the theatre and amphitheatre, immediately over
the orchestra, were by the law of L. Roscius Otho, A. U. C. 686, appro-
priated to the knights As the tribunes of the soldiers had equestri-an
rank, if the person satirised were one of them, he could therefore take his
seat in one of the fourteen rows, despite the intention of Otho, which
was to reserve the front seats for persons of genuine rank.

ψ The slaves and pirates are supposed to refer to the fleet of Sextus
PompeiuS.
