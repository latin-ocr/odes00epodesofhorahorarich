and appreh'ensions in common. If it be allowableto draw
a conjecture from the touching illustration of the fate of
Achilles, doomed in the land of Assaracus to a stormy life
and an early death, the· poem might have been written be-
tween the date of Horace's departure into Asia Minor, in· the
service of Brutus, and that of the trials and dangers which
closed at the field of Philippi, A.U.C. 712. Ritter, indeed,
places its date in the interval between the death of Cassius
and the battle of Philippi. It may, however, be observed,
that if the invitation to the feastmaster to bring forth the
wine stored in the consulship of Torquatus is to be taken
literally, wine of that age could scarcely have been found in
the commissariat of Brutus. · If not written while in the camp
of Brutus, it was probably composed between A.U.C. 712 and
716, soon after Horace's return to Rome, before the fortunes
of his life, and perhaps his political views, were changed by
the favour of Maecenas, and while his chief associates would
naturally have been among the remnants of the party with
whom he had fought, and to whose minds (if there be any-
thing peculiarly appropriate in the reference to Achilles)
military dangers in a foreign land might still be the salient
apprehension. It is evidently written some years before
Ode ix. Lib. Ι. Horace here classes himself emphatically
with the young. In Ode ix. he addresses Thaliarchus, or
the feastmaster, with the half-enviousbsentiment of a man
who points out the pleasures of youth to another—who yet
sympathises with those pleasures, but is somewhat receding
from them himself.
