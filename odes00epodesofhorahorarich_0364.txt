316 THE ODES OF HORACE.

“ ‘ To card the wool of some barbarian mistress,

And share with her the base love of a savage.' '’

While thus she raved despairing, Venus softly
Neared her, arch-smiling‚

With the boy-archer—but his bow was loosened3

And sating first her mirth‚ thus spoke the goddess:

“ Thou wilt not scold when this loathed bull returning‚
Yields to thy mercy.

⁴ “ Know thyself bride of Jove the all—subduing.
Hush sobs 3 learn well to bear thy glorious fortune 3
Thou on one section of the globe* bestowest
Name everlasting.'’

ἃ “Sectus orbis'' literally means “half the world‚” as the ancients
divided our planet only into the two great divisions‚ Europe and Asia.
