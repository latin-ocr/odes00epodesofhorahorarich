generally believed to be the Quinctilius Varus for whose
death Horace seeks to console Virgil, Ode xxiv. of this
Book.

By the way in which Bacchus and Venus are here ad-
dressed, Horace implies a temperate and elegant convivi-
ality3 Bacchus is hailed as father, benignam, not cruel 3
and Venus as “decens''—that is, accompanied with the
Graces, “ipsa decens est, cum comites sint decentes Gra-
tiae'' (Carm. i. 4, 6 3 Dillenburger) 3 and the poet proceeds to
contrast a Bacchus and a Venus so characterised with the
brawl and lust of the Centaurs, who, invited to the marriage-
feast of Peirithous, King of the Lapithae, attempted in their
drunkenness to carry off the bride and the other women,
which of course led to a fight with the Lapithae and with
the Sithonians, a people in Thrace, who were afflicted by
Bacchus with the curse of never drinking without fighting.

CARM. XVIII.

Nullam, Vare, sacra, vite prius severis arborem
Circa mite solum Tiburis et moenia Catili.
Siccis omnia nam dura deus proposuit, neque
Mordaces aliter diffugiunt sollicitudines. ,

Quis post vina gravem militiam aut pauperiem crepat?
Quis non te potius, Bacche pater, teque decens Venus*>
At, ne quis modici transiliat munera Liberi,

Centaurea monet cum Lapithis rixa super mero

Debellata, monet Sithoniis non levis Evius,

⁴ Cum fas atque nefas exiguo fine libidinum
Discernunt avidi. Non ego te, candide Bassareu,³⁶
Invitum quatiam, nec variis ob‘sita frondibus

of the thyrsus, cymbals, or images in the wild dance of the Orgies.
“ Variis obsita frondibus ” means the vessels in which the mystical sym-

bols of Bacchus were concealed, covered over with various leaves, chiefly
of vine and ivy.
