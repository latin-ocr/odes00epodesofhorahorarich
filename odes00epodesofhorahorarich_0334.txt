286 THE onEs oF HORACE.

But the Grace, with her twin naked sisters‚ shuns quarrel,
And to more than three measures refuses her sanction.
Ho 1 ho! what a joy to go mad for a time 1
Why on earth stops the breath of that fife Berecyn-
thian ?

And why is that harp so unsocially silent,
And the lively Pandean pipe idly suspended?
Quick, roses—and more 1 Let it rain with the rose Ξ
There is nothing I hate like the hand of a niggard.

Let the noise of our mirth split the ears of old Lycus.
He is envious—our riot shall gorge him with envy.
The ears of our neighbour, his wife, let it reach.
No wife could suit less the grey hairs of old Lycus?⁵

Thee‚ O Telephus, radiant with locks of thick cluster,
Thee‚ with face like the star of the eve at its clearest,
Budded Rhode is courting3 I „too am on fire‚
But me Glycera keeps in the flames burning slowly.†

⁴* The graduated process of a drinking-bout is most naturally simulated
in these verses. First stage, the amiable expansion of heart in the
friendly toast—the toleration of differing tastes ;——each man may drink
as much as he likes. Secondly‚ the consciousness of getting drunk, and
thinking it a fine thing ;—joy to go mad. Thirdly‚ the craving for
noise ;—let the band strike up. Fourthly‚ a desire for something cool ;
—roses in ancient Rome—soda-water in modern England. Fifthly,
the combative stage ;—aggressive insult to poor old Lycus. Sixth1y‚
the maudlin stage, soft and tender ;-complimentary to Telephus, and
confidingly pathetic as to his own less fortunate love-affairs.

'l' Commentators have endeavoured to create a puzzle even here,
where the meaning appears very obvious. Rhode runs after you (petit),
who are so handsome--Glycera does not run after me, but keeps me
languishing; the sense is consistent with the tone, half envious, half
sarcastic‚ with which the poet always speaks of Telephus, the typical
beauty·man and lady-killer.
