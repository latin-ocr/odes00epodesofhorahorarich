438 ΤΗΕ EPODES OF HORACE.

Remorseless crone, loud grunting o'er the toil,

With her fell spade the yawning death-pit hollows,
Wherein they bury the yet living child,

And twice and thrice each long day mock his famine?
Chin-deep (as waters on their brim suspend

The swimmer) plunged, lingering he lives in dying,
To gaze upon the food denied his lips,

Till the parched liver and the shrivelled marrow
Shall into philters for vile love consume,

When once, yet staring on the food forbidden,
The glazing eyeballs waste themselves away.

If idle N aples and each neighbouring city
Rightly believe, the Ariminian hag,

Unnatural Folia, failed not that grim conclave,
She who could draw the moon and subject stars,

With her Thessalian witch-song, down from heaven.

To them, with thumb-nail pressed to livid tooth,

Which gnawed and mumbled it, spake dire Canidia.

“ Ye of my deeds sure arbiters and faithful,
O N ight, O Hecate, who o’er silence reign

In darksome hours to rites mysterious sacred,
Now, now be present 3 now on hostile homes

Turn wrath invoked, and demon power revengeful 3
Now, while amid the horror-breathing woods

Lurk the wild beasts, couched languid in soft slumber,
Dogs of Subura,† up l bark loud 3 let all

Mock the old lecher, with a nard anointed

· † ‘⁶ Subura,'' one of the most populous and one of the most profligate
streets of Rome. Canidia prays that the barking of the dogs may rouse
the street to mock the old man, skulking to other mistresses than herself,
