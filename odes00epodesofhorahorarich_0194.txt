146 THE ODEs OF HORACE.

Where Jove bestows long springs and genia] winters,
And Aulon's mount, friend to a fertile Bacchus,
Never has cause the purple of Falernian

Clusters to envy.

Both thee and me that place, those blessed hill-topsâ€š

Invite 3 thy teaf shall there bedew the relies

Of thy lost poet-friend, while yet there lingers
Warmth in the ashes,
