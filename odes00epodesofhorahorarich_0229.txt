descended to the Grosphus of the ode as son or grandson.
In Epist. i. 12, Horace commends him to Iccius, then acting
as superintendent or steward to Vipsanius Agrippa’s estates
in Sicily, as one ‘whom Iccius might willingly oblige, for he
would never ask anything not honest and just.

religious care. If the owner has not increased the paternal fortune, he
has not diminished it.
