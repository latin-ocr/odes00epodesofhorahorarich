the remark, that it is scarcely probable that Horace would
have spoken with such confidence of his future fame till his
claims as a lyrical poet were acknowledged by competent
judges, to whom most of the odes in the first two, or per-
haps the first three, books, if not yet collected into one pub-

written in some moment of J‘oyous excitement occasioned
by a success more signal than any private invitation from
Maecenas could confer3 but we know too little of the various
stepping-stones in Horace’s poetical career to form any rea-
sonable conjecture as to its date and occasion. It is enough
that the poem itself so wonderfully vindicates the pretension
of the poet to be also the prophet.
