20 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE IV.

TO LUCIUS SESTIUS.

The Lucius Sestius here addressed was the son of the
Sestius or Sextius defended by Cicero in an oration still
extant.

Keen winter melts in glad return of spring and soft Favonius 3
And the dry keels the rollers seaward draw 3
No more the pens allure the flock, no more the hearth the
ploughman 3
Nor glint the meadows white with rime-frost hoar— ·

s

Beneath the overhanging moon, now Venus leads her dances,
And comely Graces, linked with jocund N ymphs,

Shake with alternate footthe earth, while ardent Vulcan kindles
The awful forge in which -the Cyclops toils.⁹⁵

Now well becomes anointed brows to wreathe with ver-
dant myrtle‚
ἢνΟΥ such rath flowers as swards, relaxing, free 3
And well becomes the votive lamb, or kid if more it please him,
Offered to Faunus amid shadowy groveS. ”

But all th? while, with equal step, pale Death strides on
unpausmg,
Knocks at the lowly shed and regal tower.

&Lffng hopes commenced we must not add to life's brief sum,

glad Sestius 3
Even now press on thee N ight and mythic ghostS,

And Pluto's meagre hall, which gained, the wine-king's reign

ls over—-
No more the die allots the frolic crown.†
⁷* ²1¹1< 96 ’Χ- 2³6 a:

’θ Venus dances—Vulcan toils: z'.e., in spring man reawakens both
to pleasure and labour.

ἢ* The Romans chose by east of the die the symposiarch or king of
the feast.
