448* THE EPODES OF HORACE.

EPODE VII.
To THE ROMANS.

This poem is referred by Orelli (who rightly considers it
composed at a comparatively early age) to the beginning of
the war of Perusia, A.U.C. 713-14‚ to which period the 16th
Epode is ascribed. Others refer it to A.U.c. 716, the expe-

dition

O guilty! whither, whither would ye run?

Why swords just sheathed to those right hands refitted?
Is there too little of the Latian blood

Shed on the land or wasted on the ocean,
Not that the Roman may consign to flames

The haughty battlements of envious Carthage 3
Not that the intact Briton may be seen

In captive chains the Sacred Slope descending3
But that, compliant to the Parthian’s prayer,

By her own right hand this great Rome shall perish?
Not so with wolves 3 lions not lions rend 3

The wild beast preys not on his own wild kindred.
Is it blind frenzy, or some demon Power,7⁸⁶

Or wilful crime that hurries you thus headlong?
Rep1y1 All silent 3 pallor on all cheeks,

And on all minds dumb conscience-stricken stupor.
So is it then 1 so rest on Roman heads

Doom, and the guilt of fratricidal murder,
Ever since† Remus shed upon this soil

The innocent blood atoned for by descendants.
