THE SECULAR HYMN. 335

recitative as ‘⁶ διδάσκαλος,” according to the custom of dra-
matic and lyric poets of Greece3 and (Lib. IV. Carm. vi.) the
young girls who take part in the chorus are enjoined not
only to preserve the Lesbian metre, in which the hymn was
composed, but to remember “pollicis ictum,'' the beat of
his finger in marking time.

Regarded only as a poem, the Secular Hymn, though it
deserves higher praise than Macleane and other critics have
bestowed on it, cannot be said to equal the genius exhibited
in many of the odes, especially in Book III. But if set-—
whether by Horace himself, or by others whom he more or
less schooled and directed—to some music which became a
grand national air, such as “ God save the King,'' or “The
Marseillaise,’' we can readily account for the special pride
with which he refers to it, and the increased rank which it
appears to have won for him in popular estimation.

In the Secular Hymn, and in some of the Sapphic odes
of the Fourth Book, Horace more conforms than he does in
the first three books to the ,Greek usage, in the variation of
the caesura andv the introduction of the trochee in the second
place. I have judged it necessary, for the solemnity of
feeling which is instilled into this poem, to add another foot
to the fourth line in the translation. v

CARM. SAECULARE.

Phoebe, silvarumque potens Diana,

Lucidum caeli decus, O colendi

Semper et culti, date, quae precamur
Tempore sacro,

Quo Sibyllini monuere versus

Virgines lectas puerosque castos

Dis, quibus septem placuere colles,
Dicere carmen.
