saw them, his testimony is not worth much.'' Horace, how-
ever, in this ode pays a high compliment to his poetic
powers. The ode itself is a noble homage to Pindar, and
interesting for Horace's estimate of his own peculiar powers,
and his frank confession of the pains he took with his verses.
The poem was written during Augustus’s absence from Rome
for two yearS, when, A.U.c. 7 37, the Sygambri, a fierce German
tribe (whose name Jac. Grimm derives from “ sigu,'' victory,
and “ gomber,'' strong), had, with two other tribes, invaded
the Roman territory in Gaul, and defeated the Roman legate
Lollius with great slaughter. Augustus went in person into
Gaul. The German tribes retreated at his approach, gave
hostages, and obtained peace. Augustus, however, did not
return to Rome till he had restored order in Germany, Gaul,
and Spain. As he was expected in Rome long before he
returned, the ode was probably written soon after the
Sygambri had given hostages and obtained peace, A.U.C.
738, or beginning of 739. It is commonly supposed that
Antonius had urged Horace to celebrate the triumphs of
Augustus in Pindaric style, and that he modestly excuses
himself from that request. The tone of the ode favours this
assumption, though it does not leave it clear that Antonius
had made such a request.
