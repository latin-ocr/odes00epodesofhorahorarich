160 THE omas oF HORACE.

ODE X.

TO LICINIUS.

Licinius Murena was the son of the Murena whom Cicero
defended, subsequently adopted by A. Terentius Varro.
He was then called A. Terentius Varro Murena. Maecenas
married his sister3 and Horace speaks of him subsequently -
(C. iii. 19) as one of the College of Augurs. The caution
to discretion and moderation contained in this ode has a

melancholy

Licinius, wouldst thou steer life’s wiser voyage,

N either launch always into deep mid-waters,

Nor hug the shores, and, shrinking from the tempest,
Hazard the quicksand.

He who elects the golden mean -of fortune,

Nor where dull squalor rots the time-worn hovel,

Nor where fierce envy storms the new-built palace,
Makes his safe dwelling.

The wildest winds rock most the loftiest pine-treeS,

The heaviest crash is that of falling towers,

The spots on earth most stricken by the lightning
Are its high places.

The mind well trained to eope with either fortune,
Takes hope in adverse things and fear in prosperous.
Deforming winters are restored or banished

By the same F ather„

If to-day frown, not therefore frowns to-morrow.

His deadly bow not always bends Apollo,
His hand at times the silent muse awakens

With the sweet harpstring.
