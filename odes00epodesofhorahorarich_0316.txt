268 THE onEs OF HORACE.

ODE XIII.

To THE BANDUSIAN FouNTAiN.

The site of this fountain has been a matter of controversy,
interesting to those who seek to ascertain the localities of
places endeared to them by the poets. Acron and others
assumed it to be in the neighbourhood of Horace's' Sabine
home, and identify it with the rivulet of Digentia (Licenza).
It is, however, generally now agreed, upon what appears
sufficiently competent authority, that Bandusia was in
Horace's native soil, about six miles from the site of

Venusia

Fount of Bandusia, more lucid than crystal‚
Worthy of honeyed wine, not without flowers,
I will give thee to- -morrow a kid,
Whose front‚ with the budded horn swelling,

Predicts to his future life Venus and battles 3

Vainly! The lymph of thy cold running waters
He shall tinge with the red of his blood,
Fated child of the frolicsome people 1

The scorch of the dog-star’s fell season forbears thee 3
Ever friendly to grant the sweet boon of thy.coolness
To the wild flocks that wander around,
And the oxen that reek from the harrow.

I will give thee high rank and renown among· fountains‚
When I sing of the ilex o'erspreading the hollows
Of rocks, whence, in musical fall‚⁹⁶
Leap thy garrulous silvery waters.

⁴* “Me dicente cavis impositam ilicem Saxis '’—the cavern over-
shadowed with the ilex from which the fountain gushes.—ORELL1.
