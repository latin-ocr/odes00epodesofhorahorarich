ODE XVII.

INVITATION TO TYNDARIS.

It is impossible to do more than' conjecture whether the
person addressed under the seigned name of Tyndaris ac-
tually existed or not. There are one or two touches in the
poem which seem to individualise her as a creature of the
'earth—such as the selection of one particular song about ·
the rivali-y of Penelope and Circe, which is not a theme
especially appropriate to the place of invitation, and may well

For Lucretilis oft nimble Faunus exchanges‚
So delightful its slopes, his Arcadian Lycaeus—
From my she—goats still turning aside

Rainy winds and the scorch of the sun.

Rove where arbute and thyme lurk in woodlands secreted 3
Never green adder daunts them, nor there
Martial wolf from⁴ Haedilia desoends,

Whilesoever, my Tyndaris, round and about us
Ring the smooth sheeny lime-rocks of sloping Ustica,
And the valleys embosomed below,
With the sweet haunting pipe of the god.

Over me watch the gods with an aspect of favour,
To the gods dear at heart are the muse and my worship.
Here our rich rural honours shall flow
From a brimmed cornucopia to thee.
