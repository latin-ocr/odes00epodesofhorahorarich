xlii THE ODEs OF HORACE.

Book IV. consists of thirty-four lines, and cannot therefore
be reduced to quatrain stanzas 3 and the supposition that
two verses required for such subdivision have been lost—no
evidence of such loss appearing in the oldest MSS. or being
intimated by the early commentators-is a hazardous basis
on which to rest the theory that the poem must have been
originally composed in quatrain. It is also to be observed
that Ode i. Book I. so little adapts itself to the division of
four-line stanzas with a suitable pause, that Mr Yonge fol-
lows Stallbaum in printing the first two lines as prefatory
to the rest, and the last two lines as the complement of the
stanza. But it is a somewhat bold proceeding, for the sake
of establishing an arbitrary system, thus to cut a stanza in
half, placing one half at the beginning and the other half at
the end of a poem 3 nor does the arrangement entirely effect
the object aimed at, if, as Macleane and Munro contend, a
full stop should be placed at the end of the fifth line-
“nobilis'' Even the remaining ode in this metre—Ode
xxx. Book III.—-does not readily flow into quatrain, the
pause not occurring at the fourth and eighth lines, but at the
fifth and ninth. Ι have not, therefore, in my translation,
divided these three odes into stanzas. Lastly, Ι have
followed Dillenburger, Orelli, Macleane, Munro, in the
arrangement of Ode xii. Book ΙΙΙ. as a stanza of three
lines, instead of adopting the quatrain arrangement of
Kirchner, to be found in the excursus of Orelli, and
favoured by Mr Yonge. ,

The Secular Hymn I have printed in its proper chronolo-
gical place, between Books ΙΙΙ. and IV.

Ι concur in the reasons which have led recent editors to
reject the headings to the Latin version, which are found in
the MSS. 3 but Ι have given headings to the translation, for
the convenience of reference which they afford to English
readers.

It remains for me only gratefully to acknowledge my
