134 ⁷ THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE III.

To Q. DELLIUS.

The commentator in Cruquius has Gellius for Dellius,
assuming the person addressed to be L. Gellius Poplicola,

⁴ brother of Messalla, the famous orator, But the common

supposition is that the poem is addressed to Q. Dellius, to
whose changeful and adventurous life its admonitions would
be very appropriate. Dellius sided first with Dolabella,
then went over to Cassius, then to M. Antony and Cleo-

patra. To Cleopatra he is said to have dictated the advice
that

With a mind undisturbed take life’s good and life’s evil,
Temper grief from despair, temper joy from vainglory;
⁸For, through each mortal change, equal mind,

O my Dellius, befits mortal-born,

Whether all that is left thee of life be but trouble,
Or, reclined at thine ease amid grassy recesses,
Thy Falernian‚ the choicest, records
How serenely the holidays glide.

Say, for what do vast pine and pale poplar commingle
Friendly boughs that invite to their welcoming shadow ? ἦ
Wherefore struggles and murmurs the rill
Stayed from flight by a curve in the shore ?†

Thither, lo, bid them bring thee the wine and the persumes,
And the blooms of the pleasant rose dying too swiftly 3

 

 

 

⁴* “The oldest and best MSS. have ‘quo,' which signifies ‘to what
purpose ;' as, ‘Quo mihi fortunam, si non conceditur uti?' (Epp. Ι. ν.
12.) He seems to mean, ‘What were the stream and the cool shade
given for? Bring out the wine and let us drink.'''—MACLEANE.
