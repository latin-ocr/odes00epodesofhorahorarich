42 THE oDEs OF HORACE.

ODE XI.
To, LEUco'NoE.

The desire to solve the doubts by which man is besec in χ
the present, will, perhaps, so long as the world lasts, give an
audience to those who pretend to divine the future ; and of
all modes of divination, astrology has been, from time im-
memorial, the most imposing, because it arrogates the rank
of a science, and asserts that it bases its predictions upon
deductions from a vast accumulation of facts. Rome, of
course, abounded in astrologerS, who called themselves Chal-

( daeans,

N ay, Leuconoe, seek not to fathom what death unto me—
unto thee ⁵ ι

(Lore forbidden) the gods may assign 3 nor the schemes of
the Chaldee consult*

How much better it is to learn patience, and that which
shall be to endure l

Whether Jove may vouchsafe our existence more winters,
or this be the last,

Which now breaks Tuscan ocean in spray on the time-eaten
rocks that oppose,

Be thou wise, strain thy wine, and cut down lengthened
hope to the brief span of life.

While we talk, grudging Time will be gone, and a part of
ourselves be no more.

Seize to-day—for the morrow it is in which thy belief should
be least.

 

⁴* “Nec Babylonios tentaris numeros'’—z'.e., the astrologieal calcu-
lations, or, in technical phrase, “schemes,’' sor which the Chaldees
were so famous.
