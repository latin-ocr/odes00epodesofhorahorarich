418 THE EPODES OF HORAcE.

Not that her presence could avail for succour,
Albeit she felt them underneath her wing.
Gladly in this or any war a soldier
Would I enlist, for hope of thy dear grace3
Not that, attached by ampler teams os oxen,
My ploughs may struggle through the stubborn glebe—
Not that my flocks should, ere the dog-star parcheth,
Change hot Calabria for Lucanian slopes ³*—
N ot that for me some villa's pomp of marble
Should shine down white upon luxuriant vales,
Touching the walls with which the son of Circe ἦ·
Girded enchanted land in Tusculum.
Enough, and more than Ι can need, for riches,
Thanks to thy bounty‚ is already mine ;
Ι am no Chremes, hoarding gold to buryss—
No loose-robed spendthrift lusting gold to waste.

Calabrian plains to the wooded hills of Lucania.

† Telegonus, son of Circe by Ulysses, said to have founded ancient
Tusculum on the summit of the hill, the slope of which is occupied ⁴by
the modern Frascati, and to have there introduced the magic arts of his·
mother. The lines in the original are slightly paraphrased in the trans-
lation, in order not to lose to the English reader the poetic idea associ-
ating Tusculum with legendary enchantment, which the words “ Circaea
moenia'' would have conveyed to the Latin.

ss “ ‘ Chremes.' The allusion is, perhaps, to a character in some play
of Menander.’'——MACLEANE. ⁸
