56 THE onEs oF 110RACE.

ODE XV.

THE PROPHECY OF NEREUS.

This ode is considered by critics to bear the stamp of

an early composition. It has certainly the vigour and fire.

. When the false Shepherd bore through the waters Of

In Idaean ships, Helen his hostess,
Nereus buried swift winds in loathed slumber
That Fate's fell decrees he might sing.

s

“Woe the day that thou lead'st to thy dwelling

Her whom Greece shall ask back by great armies,

Sworn in league to dissolve, with thy nuptials‚
The ancient dominion of Troy.

“ Ah 1 what death-sweat to war-horse and warrior 1

Ah ! what funerals that move with thy rowers

Bring'st thou home to the race of the Dardan 1
Already stern Pallas prepares

‘⁴ Helm, and aegis, and chariot, and fury3

Vainly, bold in the safeguard of Venus,

Shalt thou trim thy sleek locks and charm women
With songs set to chords—not of war 3 ’Χ

“ Vainly shun in thy paramour's chamberl·
Pond’rous spears and the darts of the Cretan,
And the roar of the battle 3—and Ajax

So swift when he follows a foe 3

‘⁴ Late, alas l dust shall yet smear thy love-looks.
Lo behind thee, thy race's destroyer,
Lo Ulysses l——lo Nestor l—Thee, Teucer,

Thee‚ Sthenelus skilled in the fight

* “Carmina divides ”——i.e., accompany your harp with singing.—-
YoNGE.
