EPODE V. · 435

Canidia is resolved to charm back to her, that the ,philter is
prepared, adds to the vileness which the. poet ascribes to the
hag. This epode was probably composed about the same
time as the 8th Satire of the First Book, in which Canidia
and Sagana are represented seeking the ghastly materials of
their witchcraft, and invoking Hecate and Tisiphone in the
Esquilinian burial-ground. The poem has little, of the graces
of expression which* characterise Horace's- maturer odes,
and in one or two passages the construction is faultily ob-
scure 3 but the grandeur of the whole conception, and the
vigour of the execution, need no comment, and compensate
for all defects.

The scholiasts say that Canidia's real name was Grafidia,
and that she was a Neapolitan persume-vender. That she
was ever a mistress of Horace's is a conjecture founded
upon no evidence, and nothing extant in Horace justifies
the assumption. This poem was written when Horace was
young, and he could sc-arcely have remembered, except in

his childhood, Canidia more lovely than he invariably repre-
sents her.
