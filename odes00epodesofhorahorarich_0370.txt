322 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Sweet to the wealthy the relies of change 3
Nor needs it tapestried woof nor Tyrian pall

For simple feast, whose mirth
In humble roofs unknits the brows of Care.

Now, hidden long, Andromeda' s bright sire
Glares forth revealed : now rages Procyon,
And the mad Lion-star,÷÷
As Sol brings back the sultry days of drought.

Now doth the Shepherd, with his languid flock,
Seek streams and shades, and thickets dense, the lair
Of the rough Forest-God 3
And silent margins miss the wandering winds.

All rest save thou, intent on cares of state
And fears lest aught against thy Rome be planned

In farthest east, or realm
Of Persian Cyrus, or by factious Don.

The issues of the Future a wise God
Veils in the dark impenetrable Night,
And smiles if mortals stretch
Care beyond bounds to mortal minds assigned.

That which is present heed, and justly weigh 3
All else flows onward as the river runs— ι
Now, in mid-channel calm,†
Peacefully gliding to Etruscan seas ;

Now, when wild torrents chafe its quiet streams,
Rolling, along with its resistless rush,

⁴* This fixes the season to the beginning of July, when Cepheus, a
northern star below Ursa Minor, rises. Cepheus was mythically King
of AEthiopia‚ and father of Andromeda. Procyon rises about the same
time, and is followed, eleven days afterwards, by Sirius. Leo com-

pletes the picture of summer heat.
† Orelli has “aequore''——most of the MSS. “alveo,''—-which last

reading is adopted by Ritter, Yonge, and Munro.
