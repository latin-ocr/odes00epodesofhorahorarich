100 THE onEs OF HokACE.

O D E XXIX.
To Iccms

In the 12th Ode of this Book Horace referred to the
expedition into Arabia Felix meditated by Augustus, and
which was sent from Egypt, A.U.c. 730, under the com-
mand of the Governor of Egypt, AElius Gallus. Many
Roman youths were attracted to this expedition by love
of adventure and hope of spoi13 among others, the Iccius
here addressed, who survived to become the peaceful
steward to Vipsanius Agrippa’s estates in Sicily. The
good-natured banter on the warlike ardour conceived by a
student of philosophy, was probably quite as much enjoyed
by Iccius himself as by any one. They who suppose that
so well-bred a man of the world as Horace is always insinu-
ating moral reproofs to the friends he publicly addresseS,
are the only persons likely to agree with the scholiasts that

he means gravely to rebuke Iccius for avarice in coveting
the wealth of the Arabs.

So, Iccius, thou grudgest their wealth to the Arabs,
Wouldst war on kings Sheban, as yet never conquered,
And art sternly preparing the chains
For the arms of the terrible Mede?

What virgin barbaric shall serve thee as handmaid,
Her betrothed being laid in the dust by thy falchion?
And what page, born and bred in a court,
Nor untaught Seric arrows to launch

From a bow-string paternal, with locks sleek and persumed,
Shall attend at thy feasts, and replenish thy goblets Ρ
Who that rivers can flow to their founts,
And the Tiber runs back, will deny,

If the sage of a promise so rare can surrender
All that priceless collection, the works of Panaetius,
And the school in which Socrates taught,
In exchange for a Spanish coat-mail?
