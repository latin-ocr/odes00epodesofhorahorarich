serenades. But, so far as mere conjecture from internal
evidence may be allowed, the present ode seems to have
in it a tone of earnestness which warrants a belief that the
Lyce addressed was a real person. In the three conclud-
ing stanzas, the bitterness of “sarcasm is tinged with a certain
melancholy pathos which appears to indicate the memory
of a former passion 3 and the direct reference to Cinara——
to whom all interpreters agree in considering Horace was
attached (whether or not he celebrates her under names of
the same metrical quantity, Lalage, Glycera, &c.)—gives a
peculiar air of individual truthfulness to the poem. Be this
as it may, the ode is remarkable for its eternal applicability
to a type in female character, and is replete with beauties
of expression. The image in the last stanza is extremely
striking. The simile is so simple that one might fancy it
would have occurred to any poet, yet it is so expressed as
to be quite original.

CARM. XIII.

Audivere, Lyce, di mea vota, di
Audivere, Lyce, fis anus, et tamen
Vis formosa videri,
Ludisque et bibis impudens,

Et cantu tremulo pota Cupidinem
Lentum sollicitas. Ille virentis et
Doctae psallere Chiae
Pulchris excubat in genis*

Importunus enim transvolat aridas
Quercus, et refugit te, quia luridi
DenteS‚ te quia rugae
Turpant et capitis nives,
