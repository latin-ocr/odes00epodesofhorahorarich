4, , ζ ᾗτὲΕὶᾎῦΕερΕ HORACE.

Macleane understands to signify, with a tinge of irony, the
Romans, styled by Virgil, AEn. i. 282, and Martial, xiv. 123,
“Romanos rerum dominos.’' Fortified in my own judg-
ment by authorities of such eminence, I accept this inter-
pretation. From these lords of earth Horace immediately
passes on to select representatives of the two great orders
of proprietors-—the senatorial and the equestrian: a mem-

Sprung from a race which mounts to kings, Maecenas,
Shield and sweet ornament of life to me 3

There are whose sovereign joy is dust Olympio
Gathered in whirlwind³⁶ by the car ¹; the goal

Shunned by hot wheels 3 and the palm's noble trophy—
Up to the gods it bears the lords of earth,

One—if the mob of Rome’s electors fickle
Through triple honours to exalt him vie3

One—if he harvest, stored in his own garner,
Whate'er from Libyan threshing-floors is fanned.

Treasures Attalic† could not tempt the rustic,
Delving with ready hoe paternal glebes‚

On seas Myrtoan‚ an affrighted sassor,
To indent a furrow with the Cyprian keel.

⁴* “ Collegisse juvat.'’ To have gathered together or collected the
scattered atoms of dust into a whirlwind——“pulvis collectus turbine‚’'
Sat. Ι. iv. 31.

† A proverbial phrase for great riches. The rustic here meant is the
small peasant proprietor‚ like those cultivators by spade-labour now so
common in France. The “sarculum '' was a lighter tool than a spade
