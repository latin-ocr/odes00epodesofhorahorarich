336 THE ODES OF HORACE.

O Sun, the nurturer,⁹⁵ in bright chariot leading

Day into light to hide it under shadow,

Born still the same, yet other, mayst thou never
See aught more great than Rome !

And aid the timely coming of the new-born,

Whether thou rather wouldst be as Lucina

And may it' give new blossom and new fruitage
To the grand parent-stem Ξ

So that as each eleventh solennial decade

Round to its close, this sacred feast renewing,

In song and sport, assembled Rome may hallow
Three days and j0y0us nights.

And ye, O Parcae, who have sung prophetie
Truths,§ which, once said, the sure events determine,
Fixed as divine decrees,——-a glorious future

Join to the glorious past.

Fertile in fruits and flockS‚ let Earth maternal
With spiked corn—wreath crown the brows of Ceres 3

which Diana shares with Juno, and therefore, as applied to childbirth,
imply the children born in sacred wedlock. The name ‘⁶ Genitalis ’²
is that which Diana shares with Venus, and therefore implies the off·
spring of chaste if ardent love. Thus, “whether thou preferrest the
name of Lucina or Genitalis, ” would mean, “ whether thou preferrest
