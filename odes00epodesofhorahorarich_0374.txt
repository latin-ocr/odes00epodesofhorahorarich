326 THE onus OF HoRACE.

ODE XXX.
PREDICTION OF H1s OWN FUTURE TIME.

This ode appears clearly intended to be the completing
poem of some considerable collection of lyrical pieces‚
forming in themselves an integral representation of the
idiosyncrasies of the poet in character and1'in genius, thus
becoming his memorial or “ monumentum.'' It is therefore
generally regarded as the epilogue, not to the Third Book
only, but to all the first three books 3 after the publication of
which, Horace made a considerable pause before he published
the F ourth. There is a great difference in tone between this
and Ode xx. Book 11„ addressed to Maecenas. That ode,
half sportive‚ half earnest, seems written in the effervescence
of animal spirits, and might have been called forth in any
moment of brilliant success. But this is written in dignified

and serious confidence in the firm establishment of the poet’s
fame,

I have built a monument than bronze more lasting,
Soaring more high than regal pyramids,
Which nor the stealthy gnawing of the rain-drop,
Nor the vain rush of Boreas shall destroy 3
Nor shall it pass away with the unnumbered
Series of ages and the ssight of time.
I shall not wholly die 1 From Libitina*
A part, yea, much, of mine own self escapes.
Renewing bloom from praise in after ages,
My growth through time shall be to fresher youth,
Long as the High Priest, with the Silent Virgin,
Ascends the sacred Capitol of Rome.†
