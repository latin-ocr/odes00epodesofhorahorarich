96 THE ODEs OF HORACE.

’ Thee, arch-surveyor of the earth and ocean
And the innumerous sands‚ ArchytaS, thee,
Pent in a creeklet margined by Matinus‚
The scanty boon of trivial dust keeps close.

Ι What boots it now into the halls of Heaven
To have presumed‚ and drawn empyrea] air,
Ranged through the spheres and with thy mind of mortal
Swept through creation to arrive at death?

The sire of Pelops with the gods did banquet,

And yet he died 3—remote into thin air
Vanished, if lingering long, at last Tithonus 3

Minos shared Jove’s high secrets,—yet he died.

The son of PanthoUS, though he called to witness*
His ancient buckler and the times of Troy,

That to grim death he gave but skin and sinew,
Tartarus regains,—and‚ this time, holds him fast 3

Yet 'he of Truth and Nature, in thy judgment,
Was an authority of no mean rank.

But one Night waits for all, and one sure pathway
Trodden by all, and only trodden once.

Some do the Furies to grim Mars exhibit
On the red stage in which disports his eye 3
, The greedy ocean swallows up the sailors 3
Old and young huddled swell the funeral throng 3

* The shield of Euphorbus, son of Panthous (the valiant Trojan who
wounded Patroclus), was preserved with other trophies in the temple
of Juno at or near Mycenae3 and according to a well-known legend,
Pythagoras recognised this shield as that which he had borne when he
lived in the person of Euphorbus. The son of Panthous, therefore, means
PythagoraS‚ whom the speaker sarcastically compliments as no mean
judge of truth and nature in the opinion of Archytas, who belonged to
his school.
