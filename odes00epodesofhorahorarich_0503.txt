EPODE X. 453

rum,'' it i's probable enough that he incurred the resentment
of HOrace and the scorn of Virgil 'by his attacks on their
modern style, and that his adherence to the elder forms of
Latin poe'try was uncongenial to their own taste. For
Virgil's contemptuous mention, indeed, there might be
some cause less general, if Maevius and Bavius wrote the
Anti-Bucolica ascribed to them—i.e., two pastorals in parody
of the Eclogues ; and especially if Maevius were the author
of a very ready and a very witty attempt to turn him into
ridicule. Virgil, reciting the First Book of his Georgics,
after the words, “ Nudus ara, sere nudus,’' came to a dead
halt, when some one, said to be either Maevius or Bavius,
finished the line by calling out, “habebis frigore febrem.’'
Whoever made that joke must have been elever enough to
be a disagreeable antagonist. One thing, at all events,
seems pretty evident—viz.‚ that Maevius must have had
power of some kind to excite the muse of Horace to so
angry an excess. Had he been a man wholly without mark
or following, he could scarcely have stung to such wrath
even a youthful poet. Be that as it may, this ode has all
the vigour of a good hater, and there is much of the gusto
of tru'e humour in its extravagance. The exact date of its
composition is unknown, but it bears the trace of very
early youth. Grotefend assigns it to A.U.C. 716, when
Horace was twenty-seven.
