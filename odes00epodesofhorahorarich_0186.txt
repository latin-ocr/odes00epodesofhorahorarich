138 THE onEs OF HORACE.

ODE IV.
To xANTmAs PHOCEUS.

Xanthias Phoceus is evidently a fictitious designation.
Xanthias is a Greek name, and given by Aristophanes to
slaves 3 and Phoceus characterises the person named as a

Phocian.

N ay, if thou lov’st thy handmaid, Xanthias, blush not ε

Long since the slave Briseis, with white beauty,

O'ermastering him who ne'er before had yielded‚⁹⁶
Conquered Achilles 3

So, too, the captive form of fair Tecmessa

Conquered her captor Telamonian Ajax 3

And a wronged maiden‚ in the midst of triumph,-
Fired Agamemnon, '

What time had fallen the barbarian forces

Before the might of the Thessalian victor,

And Hector’s loss made easy to worn Hellas
Troy's mighty ruin.

How dost thou know but what thy fair-haired Phyllis

May make thee son-in-law to splendid parents ?

Doubtless she mourns the wrong to raee and hearth-gods
Injured, but regal.

Believe not thy beloved of birth plebeian 3

A girl so faithful, so averse from lucre,

Could not be born of an ignoble mother
Whom thou wouldst blush for.

That lovely face, those arms, those tapering ankles——.
Nay, in my praises never doubt mine honour ε
The virtuous man, who rounds the age of forty,

Hold unsuspected.

⁴* ‘⁴ Insolentem—Achillem.’' Ι agree with Yonge in his suggestion
that “ insolentem” means “ not wont to be moved.'’
