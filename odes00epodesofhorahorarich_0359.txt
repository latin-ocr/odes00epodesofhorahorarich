mistresses 3 whereas the poem, in the digressive introduction
of the glorious fate which awaited Europa, might much more
, plausibly be supposed to intimate that some lover or spouse
of very high degree was reserved for Galatea at her journey's
end. The beautiful picture of Europa’s flight and remorse
is among the instances of Horace's exquisite adaptation of
the dramatic element to lyrical purposes.

CARM. XXVII.

Impios parrae recinentis* omen
Ducat, et praegnans canis, aut ab agro
Rava decurrens lupa Lanuvino,†

F etaque vulpes :

Rumpat et serpens iter institutum,

Si per obliquum similis sagittae

Terruit mannos : ego cui timebo
Providus auspex,

Antequam stantes repetat paludes

Imbrium divina avis imminentum,

Oscinem corvum prece suscitabo
Solis ab ortu.‡

the word is properly applied to the colour of the eye, and is between
black and tawny‚ as in many animals. Ι do not know what animals he

blue.

The raven croaking from the east was an omen of good weather, there-
fore the poet summons the raven in time to forestall the crow. He calls
, the raven “ oscinem corvum.‘' The epithetis technically augural‘. “ Os-
cines aves '’ were birds which the augurs consulted for their note, as they
consulted the birds called ‘⁶ praepetes'' for their flight. Perhaps the

epithet justifies the slight paraphrase in the last two lines of the stanza
in translation.
