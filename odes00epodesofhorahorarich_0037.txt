INTRODUCTION. xxxiii

not pretend to be better born or richer, wiser or more con—
sistent, or of a severer temper than he is. In his Satires and
Epistles he even goes out of his way to tell us of his faults.
In his Odes themselves—with all his intense and candidly
uttered convictions of their immortality—he is perpetually
throwing in some modest reference to the light and trivial
themes to which his lyre and his genius are best suited. A
man of this character, and with a very keen susceptibility to
ridicule, would perhaps shun the expression of any feeling in
love much deeper in its sentiment, or much more devoted in
its passion, than ‘would find sympathy with the men of the
world for whom he principally wrote. If he ever did com-
pose love-poenis so earnest and glowing, I think it doubtful
whether he would have prevailed on himself to publish them.
To a poet who so consistently seeks to inculcate moderation
in every passion and desire, there would have seemed some-
thing not only inconsistent with his general repute as writer,
,but perhaps something offensive to his own sense of shame
and the manliness of his nature, in that passionate devotion
to the charms of a Cynthia to which Propertius refers the
source of his inspiration and his loftiest pretension to the
immortality of renown. And ¹,Horace is so far right, both as
man and as artist, in the mode in which he celebrates the
smiling goddess round whom hovers Mirth‘ as well as Cupid 3
that, as man, one really would respect him less if any of
those young ladies, who seem to have been too large-hearted
to confine their affection to a single adorer, had inspired
him with one of those rare passions whichinfluence an entire
existence. We should feel as much shame as compassion
for any wise friend of ours whom Venus linked lastingly in
her brazen yoke to a Lydia or a Pyrrha. And as an artist,
Horace appears so far right in his mode of dealing with
erotic subjects, that, despite all this alleged want of deep
