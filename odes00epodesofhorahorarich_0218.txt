170 THE ODES OFHORACE.

O D E XIII.

TO A TREE.

Few of the odes are more remarkable than this for the
wonderful ease with which Horace rises from humorous
pleasantry into the higher regions of poetic imagination.
His escape from the falling tree seems to have made a deep
and lasting impression on him. The more probable date of
the poem is A.U.c. 728, or perhaps 729.

Evil-omened the day whosoever first planted,
Sacrilegious his hand whosoever first raised thee,
To become the perdition of races unborn,
And a stain on the country, thou infamous tree.

Ah! I well may believe that the man was a monster,
Had at night stabbed his hearth-guest, and strangled his
father,
Dealt in poisons of Colchis—committed, in short,
Every crime the most fell which the thought can con-
ce1ve 3—

He, the wretch, who thus set thee malign in my meadow,
Felon—traitor of wood, arboretal assassin,
With remorseless design coming down unawares
On the head of an innocent master like me.

Who can hope to be safe Ρ who sufficiently cautious?
Guard himself as he may, every moment's an ambush.
Thus the sailor of Carthage alarmed at a squall
In the Euxine, may find his least danger at sea.

Thus the soldier of Rome mails his breast to the Parthian,
And believes himself safe if secure from an arrow 3
And the Parthian, in flying Rome’s dungeon* and chains,
Fondly thinks that in flight he escapes from the grave 2
