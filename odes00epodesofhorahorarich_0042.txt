xxxviii THE ODEs oF HORACE.

tomed themselves to one edition than a new one appears to
challenge the authority they had deferred to, and disturb
the reading they had accepted. Paraphrases and transla-
tions are still more numerous than editions and commen-

one time or other versified or imitated some of the odes 3
and scarcely a year passes without a new translation of them

accorded to new translations from Horace. Readers un-
acquainted with the original are disposed to welcome every
fresh attempt to make the Venusian Muse express herself
in familiar English3 and Horatian scholars feel an interest
in examining how each succeeding translator grapples with
the difficulties of interpretation which have been, as many
of them still are, matters of conjecture and dispute to com—
mentators the most erudite, and critics the most acute.

May a reasonable share of such general indulgence be
vouchsafed to that variety in the mode of translation of
which Ι now propose to hazard the experiment.

Ι have long been of opinion that the adoption of other
rhymeless measures than that to which we at present con-

especial advantage in translations from the classical poets‚
and, indeed, in poems founded upon Hellenic and Roman
myths, and treated in the classical character and spirit. In
that belief Ι began many years ago these translations from
