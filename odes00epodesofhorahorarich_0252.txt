204 THE oDEs oF HORACE.

To him who curbs desire within the bounds of ‘ The
Enough,’ .
Α The wildest blasts that heave the sea awake no fear of wreck3
He quails not though Arcturus set,
Or Haedus rise‚ in storm3

Though reel the vines beneath the hail, though crops belie
the hope,
Though trees despoiled of fruit accuse now spring's corrod-
ing showers,
Now summer’s scorch and fiery stam,
. Now winter’s crowning wrongs.

Lo, where the mighty moles extend new lands into the deep,
The scaled races feel their sea shrink round the invading
piles 3
As many a builder’s burly gang
Heaves the huge rubble downff

Obedient to a lord who scorns so small a bound as earth 3
Yet Conscience‚ whispering fears and threats‚ ascends with
him the tower‚
Black Care sits by him in the bark,
Behind him, on the steed.†

Since Phrygian marbless nought avails to soothe a mind
diseased‚

And nought the pomp 'of purple robes albeit outshining stars,
And nought the Achaemenian balm,
Nought the Falernian vine 3

* “ Huc frequens
Caementa demittit redemptor
Cum famulis.’
“ Caementa,'' the rough mixture of large and small stones‚ mortar, διο.
(rubble)‚ which served for foundations. “Redemptor,'’ literally the
‘⁴ contractor ’' or “architect.” ’
