88 THE ODEs OF HORACE.

ODE XXVI.

TO L. AELIUS LAMIA.

Horace addresses this same Lamia again, Lib. III. Ode
xviii. Lamia must have been very young when this ode was
written, the date of which is to be guessed from the refer-
ence to Tiridates and the Parthian disturbances. Assum-
ing with Orelli, Macleane, and others, that it was composed
A. U. c. 729, just before Tiridates fled from his kingdom,

Lamia survived fifty-seven years, dying A. U. C. 786 (Tac.
Ann.‚ vi. 27).

Ι, the friend of the MuseS‚ all sear and all sorrow
Will consign to wild winds as a freight for Crete's ocean 3
· I'm the one man who feels himself safe,
Whatever king reigns at the Pole—

Whatever the cause that appals Tiridates.
Muse, thou sweetener of life, haunting'nhill-tops Pimpleian‚
Whose delight is in founts ever pure,
Weave the blooms opened most to the sun—

O weave for the brows of my Lamia the garland : .

N ought my praise without thee. Let thyself and thy sisters
Make him sacred from Time by the harp
Heard at Lesbos; but new be its stringS.
