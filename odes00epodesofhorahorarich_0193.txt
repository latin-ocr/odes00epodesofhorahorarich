CARM. VI.

Septimi, Gades aditure mecum et

Cantabfuff] indoctum juga ferre nostQt

Barbaras Syrtes, ubi Maura semper
AEstuat unda,

Tibur Argeo positum colono

Sit meae sedes utinam senectae,

Sit modus lasso maris et viarum
Militiaeque.

Unde si Parcae prohibent iniquae,
Dulce pellitis* ovibus Galaesi

Flumen et regnata petam Laconi
Rura Phalantho.†

Ille terrarum mihi praeter omnes

Angulus ridet, ubi non Hymetto

Mella decedunt, viridique certat
Baca Venafro 3
