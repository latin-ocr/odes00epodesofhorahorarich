BOOK 1.--ODE 111. 17

position that this ode was addressed to Virgil the poet, on
the occasion of the voyage to AthenS, from which he only
returned to die: but there is no reason why Virgil should
not have made or contemplated such a voyage before the
last one 3 and Macleane, here agreeing with Dillenburger, is
“inclined to think such must have been the case.’'-See
his introduction to this ode.

CARM. III.

Sic te Diva potens Cypri,
Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,

Ventorumque regat pater
Obstrictis aliis praeter Iapyga,

Navis, quae tibi creditum
Debes Virgilium finibus Atticis

Reddas incolumem precor,⁷'⁵
Et serves animae dimidium meae.

Illi robur et aes triplex

Circa pectus erat, qui fragilem truci
Commisit pelago ratem

Primus, nec timuit praecipitem Africum

Decertantem Aquilonibus,
- Nec tristes Hyadas, nec rabiem Noti,
Quo non arbiter Hadriae
,Majon tollere seu ponere vult freta.

certainly true, that the 2d pers. pres. subj. (reddas), is never used as a
mere imperative, = ‘ redde.’ It may be used precativeht in addressing
a deity, a superior (or in politeness)‚ as ‘serves’ in Ode xxxv. 1. 29.
Where it is used with ⁴ precor,’ the verb is not in parenthesis, but dis-
tinctly governs ‘ reddas,’ ‘ I pray you to render.' There should there-
'fore be no comma between them3 and this view shows ‘ precor’ to be
the true apodosis of the passage.''
