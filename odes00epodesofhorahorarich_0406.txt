358 THE ODEs OF HORAOE.

ODE IV.
IN PRAISE OF DRusus AND THE RACE OF THE NEROS.

When, A.U.C. 7 38-9, Augustus and Tiberius were in Trans-
alpine Gaul, the fierce tribes Of the Vindelici and Raeti (the
first occupying a considerable range of country between the
Danube and Lake Constance, the last neighbouring them to
the south, and extending to Lake Como) made forays into
Italy and Cisalpine Gaul, attended with great cruelty and
massacre. Augustus sent against them Drusus, the younger
brother of Tiberius, who was then in his twenty-third year.
He defeated and drove them from Italy. It is clearly in
honour Of the victory under Drusus that the ode is com-
posed. But as these tribes renewed their predatory incur-
sions into Gaul, Tiberius wa's sent to the' aid Of Drusus with
additional forces, Thus united, the two brothers reduced
these and Other tribes—such as the Genauni and Breuni
—into the Roman province of Raetiae (Raetia Prima and
Secunda). It was in honour of this completed conquest,
and Of the part which Tiberius had in it, that Ode xiv. was
composed, and, as may be reasonably supposed, somewhat
subsequently to Ode iv. The opening of this poem is un-

usually
Even as the thunder's winge'd' minister—
To whom, proved true to Jove's entrusted charge
In gold-haired Ganymede,
Heaven's king gave kingdom over wandering birds——

Urged from his eyrie by the goad Of youth,
And pulses glowing with ancestral fire,
Learns from the winds Of spring,
When gone the rain-clouds, timidly to soar,

T ill On the sheepfold rushes down its foe 3
Next, bolder grown, the hungering greed not less
