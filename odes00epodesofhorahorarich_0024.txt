XX THE ODES OF HORACE.

felt the old liberty rather voluntarily slip than be violently
wrenched, from their hands, abenevolent autocracy that con-
sults the public opinion which installs it, seems a blessing to
the many, and is accepted as a necessity by the few. And
if the professed statesmen and politica] thinkers of the time
——the Pollios and the Messalas, the most eminent parti-
sans of M. Antony, the noblest companions of Brutus— Β
acquiesced, with the more courtly and consistent Maecenas,

gloomy anticipations of the distant future, that he could not
foresee the terrible degeneration of manners and the military
despotism which were destined to grow out of the clement
autocracy of that accomplished prince who had won the title
of “ father of his country,’' and who might be seen on
summer evenings angling in the Tiber, or stretched upon
its banks amidst a ring of laughing children, with whom the
Emperor whose word gave law to the Indian and the Mede

tastes, contribute to the culture and amenities of the poet
who would make his monument more lasting than bronze and

to evince that with him they were rules of art 3 so successful as
to make them worthy of study, and hitherto so little noticed,
even by his most elaborate critics, as to justify an attempt to
render them more generally intelligible and instructive.

In what I am about to say on this head, I confine my
remarks to the short lyrical pieces to which commentators
