400 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Sparkling gems, and the purples of Cos,÷÷
Cannot back to thee bring the dead years
Rapid Time has interred in our annals‚
For all men to number their graves.†

Whither fled is the beauty? alas 1
Where the bloom? where the movement of grace?
Of that—O of that—what is left thee,
Breathing loves, which stole me from myself‚

Blest successor to Cinara thou,
Gracious form,‡ for arts pleasing renowned?
But to Cinara few years were conceded,
By the Fates who have Lyce preserved

To be rival in age to the crow,
That the young, glowing yet, may behold,
As a subject of mirth, in those ashes
The fallen remains of a torch.

ὕ Horace speaks of the robes from Cos in Sat. Ι. ii. line 100, as so
transparent that they left nothing to conceal.

† “Tempora‚ quae semel
Notis condita fastis
Inclusit volucris dies.”
“Horace means to say that the days she has seen are all buried‚ as it
were, in the grave of the public annals (as Acron says), and there any
one may find them, but she cannot get them back. It is a graphic way
of identifying the years, and marking their decease, to point to the
record in which each is distinguished by its consuls and its leading
events. ‘N otis’ merely expresses the publicity and notoriety of the
record by which the lapse of time is marked.''—MACLEANE.

‡ “Notaque et artium
Gratarum facies?'’
“ ‘Facies’ does not mean the face alone, but the whole form and
presence. ‘Facies autem totam corporis speciem significat.'''-—D1L·
