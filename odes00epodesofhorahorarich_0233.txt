“ Vita dum superest bene est :
Hanc mihi vel acuta
Si sedeam cruce sustine.” ⁴*
If this sentiment was sincerely expressed, the pathos of the
poem is increased. A man so dreading death may well
desire a companion in the last Journey.v And it is not un·
likely that the melancholy view which Horace habitually
takes of the next world, and his exhortations to make the
best of this one, may have been coloured, perhaps insensi-
bly to himself, by his conversations and intercourse with

Maecenas.

CARM. XVII.

Cur me querelis exanimas tuis?
Nec dis amicum est nec mihi te prius
Obire, Maecenas, mearum
Grande decus columenque rerum.

Ah l te meae si partem animae rapit
Maturior vis, quid moror altera,
N ec carus aeque nec superstes
Integer? Ille dies utramque

Ducet ruinam. Non ego perfidum
Dixi sacramentum: ibimus, ibimus,
Utcunque praecedes, supremum
Carpere iter comites parati.

*V The fragment is thus very happily rendered into English by Mr
Farrar in the biographical essay on Seneca, which forms the larger por-
tion os his impressive and eloquent work, ‘ The Seekers after God ’ :—

“ Numb my hands with palsy,

Rack my feet with gout,

Hunch my back and shoulder,
Let my teeth fall out ;

Stin, if [ιβ’ be granted,
I prefer the loss—

Save my life and give me

’ Anguish on the cross.''
