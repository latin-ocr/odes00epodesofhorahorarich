Telephus‘is altogether a poetic fiction 3 neither am I satis-
fied with the grounds upon which Ritter identifies the
Telephus of Ode xiii.·Book 1.‚ and xix. Book II-I.‚=with
Heliodoruss the grammarian and· Greek scholar mentioned
Serm. i. 5·‚ 2, and assumes that another person is designated
under that name in this ode. Nothing is more likely than
that among Horace’s gayer companions there was some one
very good-looking gallam, celebrated for his bonnes fortzmes
among the freedwomen of Rome, whom the poet always
designates' under the name of Telephus. It is observable
that there is considerable consistency in the way in which
Telephus is ⁴mentiOned in ,Horace, with a good-humoured,
half-envious admiration for personal gists, and whom, on the
single occasion (Carm. xix. Lib. ΙΙΙ.) in which the hand-
some gentleman seems disposed to bore with an unseason-
able display of learning, he puts back into his-right place
as reveller and gallant, with a certain superiority‚ such as,
when it came to a display of learning, a Horace might be
’ disposed to assume towards a Telephus.

CARM. XI.

Est mihi nonum superantis annum

Plenus Albani cadus3 est in horto,

Phylli, nectendis apium coronis ;
Est hederae vis

Multa, qua crines religata fulges 3 ,

Ridet argento domus ; ara castis

Vincta verbenis avet immolato
Spargier agno 3

Cuncta festinat manus, huc et illuc
Cursitant mixtae pueris· puellae 3
