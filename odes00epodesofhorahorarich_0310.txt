262 THE ODES OF HORACE.

The tortured lips of Tityos and Ixion

Reluctant smiled3 awhile their um stood thirsting

As paused the Danaids‚ to the charmer's music
Dreamily listening.

Let Lyde hear the guilt of those stern virgins,
Hear, too, their well-known penance ‚- doomed for ever
To toil at filling up a sieve-like vessel 3

Tell her how surely

' Slow fates await such crimes‚——though under Orcus 3
Impious—for can impiety be greater?
Impious in giving to the sword their bridegrooms,
Ruthlessly murdered.⁹⁶

Amidst the many, One alone was worthy

The nuptial torch 3—a maid, through all the ages,

By glorious falsehood to her perjured father,
Nobly immortal.

‘⁴ Rise‚” to her youthful bridegroom, thus she whispered 3
‘⁴ Rise, lest there come, and whence thou dost suspect not,
Into thy lids the everlasting slumber Σ

Baffle my father3

“ Elude my blood-stained sisters—lionesses 3

Each—woe is me l——her separate victim rending:

Of softer mould‚ I can nor strike nor pen thee
Here, in these shambles 1

 

⁴* The old mythologists differ among themselves as to the fable of
Danaus and the fate of his daughters. Horace here adopts the com-
mon story that Danaus, having reason to think that the fifty sons of his
brother AEgyptus were plotting against him, fled with his fifty daughters
from Libya (the domain assigned him by his father Belus, AEgyptus
having Arabia), and ultimately became King of Argos. His nephews
came to his new realm and demanded his daughters in marriage.
