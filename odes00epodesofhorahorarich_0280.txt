232 THE ODES OF HORACE.

'Tis by his thunder we believe· Jove reigns
In heaven ε on earth,÷÷ as a presiding god,
When to his realm annexed

Briton and Persian‚† Caesar shall be held !

What 1 hath the soldier who with Crassus served,

Lived the vile spouse of a barbarian wife Ρ
Shame to Rome’s Senate! ss shame

On manners that invert the Rome of old.

Marsian‚ Apulian, sons-in-law to foes
Of their own sires ! grown grey in hireling mail
Beneath a Median king 1
Oblivious of the sacred shields of Mars,

Oblivious both of toga and of name,
And Vesta's unextinguishable fire, ᾗ
While yet live Jove and Rome 1 ΙΙ
Ah Ξ this the provident mind of Regulus

Foresaw‚ when arguing that to buy from Death
Captives unworthy pity, on vile terms,
Would serve in after days,
As the sure precedent of doom to Rome.

“ I‚” thus he said, “have with these eyes beheld
The Roman standards nailed to Punic shrines ;
From Roman soldiers seen
The bloodless weapons wrenched without a blow 3

‘ cae10.’ ''——-MACLEANE.

ss “ Pro Curia,” &eff—viz„ “Shame to the Senate for the seandal
to its dignity in having so long endured a disgrace so ignominious.'’—
ORELLI.

ἓ “ Horace collects the most distinguished objects of a Roman’s rev-
erence-—his name, his citizenship (togae), the shield of Mars only to be
lost, and the fire of Vesta only to be extinguished, when Rome should
perish.''—MACLEANE.
