EPODE 1v. 43 1

leane in his prefatory comment on the ode. In some in-
scriptions Vedius Rufus has been named instead of MenaS.
Ritter‚maintains the accuracy of this identification, and
affirms that it was no other than Vedius Pollio, a Roman
knight, who had been originally a freedman, mentioned by
Seneca, Pliny, and others—See Ritter’s note.

CARM. IV.

Lupis et agnis quanta sortito obtigit,
Tecum mihi discordia est,

Hibericis peruste funibus÷÷ latus,
Et crura dura compede.

Licet superbus ambules pecunia,
Fortuna non mutat genus.

Videsne, Sacram metiente te Viam†
Cum bis trium ulnarum toga,‡

Ut ora vertat huc et huc euntium
Liberrima indignatio? ξ

‘ Sectus flagellis hic triumviralibus
Praeconis ad fastidium ΙΙ

Arat Falerni mille fundi jugera
Et Appiam mannis terit,'

Σ “Cum bis trium ulnarum toga.'’ According to Macleane, this
applies to the width of the toga, not the length, as commonly trans-
lated ; I follow his interpretation, but it is disputed.

ἓ “ Ut ora vertat huc et huc euntium
Liberrima indignat10.''

Ι think with Macleane that this appears rather to mean the open in·
dignation which made the passengers turn their looks tozcsards him, than
turn away in disgust, which is the construction of the scholiasts. Yonge
suggests a totally different interpretation ε “ See how a free ” (i. e.,
unreserved, undisguised) “ scorn alters the countenance '' (ora vertat)
“of all who pass along.'’

ΙΙ The Triumviri Capitales had the power of inflicting summai-y chas-
tisement on slaves, When the scourge was inflicted, a public crier stood
by and proclaimed the nature of the crime.
