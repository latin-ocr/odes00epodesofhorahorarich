CARM. XVIII.

Faune, Nympharum fugientum amator,
Per meos fines et aprica rura
Lenis incedas abeasque parvis

AEquus alumnis 3

Si tener pleno cadit haedus anno,

Larga nec desunt Veneris sodali

Vina craterae. Vetus ara multo
Fumat odore,⁹⁵

Ludit herboso pecus omne camp0‚
Cum tibi Nonae redeunt Decembres ;
Festus in pratis vacat otioso

Cum bove pagus-3 ’
Inter audaces lupus errat agnos3
Spargit agrestes tibi silva frondes ;
Gaudet invisam pepulisse fossor

Ter pede terram.†

 

leane, it is well to subjoin his reasons for the innovation. “ I have not
followed the usual punctuation, which makes ‘ sumat’ depend upon ‘ si,’
with a comma at ‘ craterae,’ and a period at ‘odore.' Horace claims the
protection of Faunus for his lambs in the spring on the ground of his
due observance of the rights of December, which he then goes on to
describe. ‘ Pleno anno ' means at the end of the year when the Faunalia
took place.” Therefore the division in the poem at which, after the in-
vitation to Faunus in the spring, Horace passes on to describe the festi-
val in the winter, is more intelligible, and far less abrupt, by commencing
it with the sacrifice on the altar.
'l‘ “ Gaudet invisam pepulisse fossor
Ter pede terram.'’

‘⁶ ‘Fossor’ is put generally, I imagine, for a labouring husbandman,
who may be supposed to have no love for the earth that he digs for
another.'’—MACLEANE. This triple stamp is a dancing measure, which
is likened to the anapaest, where two feet are short and one long. Mac-
leane quotes Sir John Davies’s poem (Orchestra) in explanation of this

measure “ And still their feet an anapaest do sound‚'' Sec.

But it is perhaps best understood by any one who happens to have
learned, in the old-fashioned hornpipe, that step familiarly called “toe2
beel, and cloe,''—touching the ground lightly with the toe, next with
the heel, and then bringing down the whole sole of the foot with a stamp.
Ι have seen that step, or something very like it, performed in a village
dance in the south of Italy.
