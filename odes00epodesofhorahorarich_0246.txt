198 THE oDEs OF HORACE.

Than the swift son of Daedalus swifter I travel.
I shall visit shores loud with the boom of the Euxine,
And fields Hyperborean and African sands,
And wherever I wander shall sing as a bird.

Me the Colchians shall know, me the Dacian⁹⁵ dissembling
His dismay at the might of his victor the Roman 3
Me Scythia's far son 3—learned students in me
Shall be Spain's rugged child and the drinker of
Rhone. †

Not for me raise the death-dirge‚ mine urn shall be empty;‡
Hush the vain ceremonial of groans that degrade me,
And waste not the honours ye pay to the dead
On a tomb in whose silence Ι shall not repose.

ἦ “ Et qui dissimulat metum
Marsae cohortis Dacus.’'
The Marsian infantry was the flower of the Roman armies, and the Mar-
sian here represents the might of Rome. Either the interruption to the
rapidity of the verse by the allusion to the Dacian's haughty dissimula-
tion of the terror with which he regards the Roman arms must be con-
sidered, as it has been considered by critics, one of those “impertinences„'’
for the sake of a popular hit, which is noticed in the preliminary essay as
a defect in Horace; or it may possibly escape that reproach, and, per-
tinently to the purpose of the poem, mean that whatever the disguised
terror in which the Dacian holds the Roman soldier, he will welcome
the Roman poet.
Ἰ· “ Me peritus
Discet Hiber, Rhodanique potor.”

“ Peritus Hiber'' does not mean “the learned Spaniard,'' as it is com-
monly translated. The adjective applieS, as in similar cases is habitual
with Horace, both to “ Hiber ” and “ Rhodani potor ;’' and as Dillen-
burger, Orelli, and Macleane agree, the meaning is, “that these barbaric
nations will become versed in me.’' Macleane thinks that by “ Hiber ’²
is probably meant the Caucasian people of that name ; 1 follow, how-
ever, the interpretation popularly accepted—and sanctioned by Orelli
-that “ Hiber '' means “the Spaniard.'' The “Drinker of Rhone ” is
the Gaul. ’
