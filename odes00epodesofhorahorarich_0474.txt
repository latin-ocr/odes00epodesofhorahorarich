426 THE EPODES OF HORACE.

EPODE III.
‘ro MAECENAS IN EXECRATION OF GARLIC.

Horace appears to have been tempted to eat, when dining
with Maecenas, some dish over-seasoned with garlic, unaware
of the prevalence of that ingredient, or unprescient of its
effects. Some commentators, whom Dillenburger follows,
