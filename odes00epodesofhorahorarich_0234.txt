186 THE omzs OF HORACE.

Me, no flames bursting forth from the jaws of Chimaera,
Me, no Gyas once more rising up hundred-handed,
Could dispart from thyselss—such the will
Of omnipotent Justice and Fate.

Whether Libra, or Scorpio with aspect³⁵ malignant,
In mine horoscope, ruled o'er the Houses of Danger,
Or moist Capricorn‚ lord of the west;
It is strange how oui· stars have agreed.

Thee‚ thine own native Jupiter snatched from fell Saturn,
And outshining his beam, stayed the wings of the Parcae,
When the theatre hailed thee restored,
And the multitude thrice shouted joy.

Me the fall of the tree would have brained, had not Faunus,
To men born under Mercury, guardian benignant,
O’er my head stretched the saving right hand,
And made lighter the death-dealing blow.

Then forget not to render to Jove, the Preserver
Of a life so august, votive chapel and victims,
While Ι, to mine own sylvan god,
Offer grateful mine own humble lamb.

astrologers‚ according to whom the native star may be evilly aspected
in various ways. But “pars violentior’' would apply to the hostile
influences affecting “the Lord of life,’' chiefly found in the significa-
tions of the 8th and 12th House. By his allusion to Capricorn‚ Horace
clearly refers to his dangers by sea—“Sicula unda.’‘ To astrology (a
science then so much in fashion) Horace often refers—sometimes with
scom, sometimes with a seeming credulity—always as a man who
knew very little about it. But where he speaks of it with scorn, as in
addressing Leuconoe, Book Ι. Ode xi„ it is less to denounce astro-
logy itself as an imposture, than to dissuade from all attempts to
divine the future— “better that the future should remain unknown
