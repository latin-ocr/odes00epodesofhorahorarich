BOOK IL—-ODE XIX. 195

Disjecta non leni ruina,
Thracis et exitium Lycurgi*

Tu flectis amnes, tu mare barbarum‚†
Tu separatis uvidus in J’ugis
’ Nodo coerces viperino

Bistonidum sine fraude crines,

Tu, cum parentis regna per arduum
Cohors Gigantum scanderet impia,
Rhoetum retorsisti leonis
Unguibus horribilique mala ;

Quamquam, choreis aptior et jocis
Ludoque dictus, non sat idoneus
Pugnae ferebaris ε sed idem

Μ

’ Pacis eras mediusque belli.

Te vidit insons Cerberus aureo

Cornu decorum, leniter atterens
Caudam, et recedentis trilingui
Ore pedes tetigitque crurass

of the rivers;'' the reference is to the Hydaspes and Orontes, over
which Bacchus is said to have walked dryshod; and “flecto’' here
must be taken either in the sense of “to bow ’' or “direct,’' or, in
its more metaphorical sense, “to appease.‘' By “mare barbarum”
is meant the Indian Ocean.

‡ Orelli observes that in this stanza there are two images‚——one at
the entrance of Liber into Hades‚ when Cerberus gently wags his tail to
greet him—the other when Liber is leaving and the Hell-dog licks his
feet. The poet thus expresses the security with which the god passes
through the terrors of the nether world.
