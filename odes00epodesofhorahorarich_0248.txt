200 THE ODES -OF HORACE.

BOOK III.——ODE I.

ΟΝ ΤΗΕ WISDOM OF CONTENT.

This ode opens with a stanza which modern critics gene—
rally consider to be an introduction not only to the ode
itself, but also to the five following—all six constituting‚ as
it were, serial parts of one varied poem, written about the
same tirne and for the same object—viz„ to aid in the refor-
mation of manners which Augustus undertook at the close
of the civil wars. The date of these and other odes con-
ceived in the same spirit <as Lib. ΙΙ. Od. xv. and xviii.)
would therefore be referable to the period from A.U3c. 72 5
to A.U.C. 728. The first line of the introductory stanza to
this ode imitates the formal exhortation of the priest at the
Mysteries, warning away the profane. The conclusion of
the stanza, “Virginibus puerisque canto,” if, as recent inter-

preters
Ι hate the uninitiate crowd--I drive it hence away3
Silence, while Ι, the Muses’ priest, chant hymns unheard
before 3
I chant to virgins and to youths,
I chaunt to listeners pure.

Dread kings control their subject flocks 3 o'er kings them-
selves reigns Jove,
Glorious for triumph won in war when giants stormed his

heaven,
And moving with almighty brow ⁹⁵
The universe of things.

⁴* “ Cuncta supercilio moventis.” With his usual felicity of wording,
Horace avoids the commonplace expression of “the Olympian nod,”
, though the line implies that and something more ; it implies the Deity’s
intellectual government of all things, and explains the connection with
the stanzas that'immediately follow,-—the nod of Jove confirms the law
os Fate to which all men are subjected.
