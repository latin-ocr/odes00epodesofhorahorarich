210 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Virtue ne'er knows of a defeat which brings with it disgrace 3ss
The blazon ⁴of her honours ne’er the breath of men can stain 3
Her fasces she nor takes nor quits
As veers the popular gale.

Virtue essays her flight through ways to all but her denied ;
To those who do not merit death she opes the gates of
heaven,
And, spurning vulgar mobs and mire,
Soars with escaping wing.

There is a silence unto which a safe reward is due.
With him whose tongue the sacred rites of Ceres blabs abroad‚
May I ne'er sit beneath a roof,
Nor launch a shallop frail 1

For Jove neglected oft confounds the good man with the
bad ·
And though airenging Punishment is lame indeed offoot,
Yet rarely lag's she long behind
The swiftest flight of Crime.

ἶ “ Virtus, repulsae nescia sordidae,
Intaminatis fulget honoribus.”
The meaning of these lines has been much disputed, but seems to me
sufficiently clear. The point is in the epithets‚ “ sordidae‚’' “ intamina-
tis.'' It cannot be truly said that Virtue is ignorant or unconscious of a
defeat or rejection (“ repulsae’' applies to the defeat at a popular elec-
tion (a), but it is, said truly that Virtue knows not any such defeat as can
disgrace her (sordidae). The honours that Virtue seeks are distinguished
from civil honours, insomuch as the latter, being conceded by the people
or the state, are by the people or the state to be reversed or sullied 3 but

(a) Thus, in the Epistles, 1. i. 42, Horace says,—
, “ Vides, quae maxima credis
Esse mala, exiguum censum turpemque repulsam ;'' Ι
which Macleane, referring to “repulsae-sordidae” of this ode, interprets quaindy,
⁴⁴ He who would secure an election must have a command of money.”
