384 THE ODEs OF HORACE.

ODE IX.

To LOLLIUS.

As the preceding poem was addressed to a man who re-
tained unblemished a popular reputation to the last, and
whose death was considered a public calamity, so this poem,
which equally treats of the immortality it is the gift of poets
to bestow, is addressed to one who, if we are to take for
granted such historical records of him as are left, was the
subject of merited obloquy in his later years, and died by
poison which he administered to himself, to the great joy of

his countrymen. And it was for the vices most opposite to
the special virtues Horace here ascribes to Lollius—viz., for

rapacity and corruption—that his character, rightly or wrong-
ly, has been most defamed. His vindication has been, how-
ever, very ably attempted by Tate (‘Vindiciae Lollianae'), and
the evidence against him is generally considered to rest

upon prejudiced and questionable authority.—-See Estre,
Hor.

Lest, perchance, thou believe that the words which to music,
I, whose birth was where Aufidus rushes far-sounding‚
Linked by arts not before me divulged,
Are but sounds that are fated to die ,-

Remember, that though the first throne be great Homer’s,
There are muses not tuneless, Pindaric and Caean 3
With Alcaeus, yet threatening and fierce 3
With Stesichorus, stately and grave.

Time destroys not what once sported loose in Anacreon3
To this day breathes the love, to this day glows the ardour,
Which the girl of AEolia consigned
To the strings of her passionate lyre.
