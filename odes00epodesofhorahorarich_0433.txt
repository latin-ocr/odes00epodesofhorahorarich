BOOK 1v.——0DE IX. 385

Hor. Pros, At all events it is clear that the vices imputed
to him by his personal enemy, Sulpicius Quirinus, and Vel-
leius Paterculus, the adulator of TiberiuS‚ were not sus-
pected by Augustus, with whom, even after his defeat by
the Sygambri, A.U.C. 737, he retained eminent favour and
influence, and who subsequently appointed him tutor to his
grandson, Caius Caesar. If Lollius could deceive Augustus
as to his real nature, it has been shrewdly observed that he
‚ might well deceive Horace. The exact date of the ode is
unknown, but it has the appearance of being written aster
Lollius's defeat and recall 3 at all events, it was published
not long after it, and is therefore an evidence of Horace’s
generous desire to soothe and sustain his friend in a time
of reverse, and, no doubt, of unpopularity. The latter part
of the poem is in Horace's noblest style of sentiment and
expression. Ritter maintains that Epistles ii. and xviii„
Lib. I., are addressed to the Lollius of the ode3 but most
critics consider them to be addressed to his eldest son.

CARM. IX.

Ne forte credas interitura, quae
Longe sonantem natus ad Aufidum,
Non ante volgatas per artes
Verba loquor socianda chordis :

Non, si priores Maeonius tenet
Sedes HomeruS, Pindaricae latent,
Ceaeque, et Alcaei minaces,
Stesichorique graves Camenae 3

Nee, si quid olim lusit Anacreon,
Delevit aetas 3 spirat adhuc amor,
Vivuntque commissi calores

AEoliae fidibus puellae.
