122 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Speeding, on to transfix into true forms of terror
’ The visions which fumes Mareotic⁹⁶ engender‚
As falcon that swoops on the dove,
As hunter that chases the hare

On the snow plains of Haemus,—from Italy plying
Rapid oars on her flight near and nearer comes Caesar,
To chain, as the gapeshow of Rome,
The fair fatal monster. Too great

For such end, she but sought by what death to defy it,
She recoiled from the sword with no womanlike shudder,
She crowded no sail to far shores
Where life might lurk safe and obscure.

Brave to gaze with calm look round her desolate palace,
Strong to grasp with firm hand and provoke the fierce

serpents
That, there where she fixed them, her veins
Might best the black venom imbibe 3

Bolder made in the death thus assured by stern purpose,
She begrudged to the savage Liburnians† their captive ;
In no insolent triumph was drawn
Discrowned, the grand woman-queen.

³* “Mentemque lymphatam Mareotico.” “Lymphatam ’' denotes panic
or visionary terrors (“ lymphata somnia ''). “ Lympha '' and “ nympha, ’'
as Macleane observes, are the same word. Nympholepsy was the mad-
ness occasioned by the sight of the nymph flashing up from the fountain‚
scaring the traveller out of his senses 3 and “lymphatus '’ literally means
“ driven mad by the glare of water.’' Horace ascribes this effect to the
fumes, or perhaps rather the sparkle, of the Mareotic wine, produced on
the banks of Lake Mareotis, in the neighbourhood of Alexandria.

† “ Liburnians‚’' light swift-sailing vessels, which constituted a chief
portion of Augustus's fleet at Actium·
