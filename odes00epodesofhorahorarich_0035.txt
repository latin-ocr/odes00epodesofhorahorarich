ceptible imitation. But the study of so exquisite a beauty
in lyrical composition may be safely commended to modern
poets. It is noticeable that Horace has little or nothing
of it in the Epodes (his earliest published poems, except the
First Book of the Satires). Perhaps he thought it more espe-
cially appropriate to purely lyrical composition, such as the
Odes, than to the Epodes, which are not lyrical in form,
and, with one exception, Epode xiii„ are but partially lyrical
in spirit. For it might be wrong to infer that it only oc-
curred to him in the riper practice of his general art as poet,
since some of the Odes in which it is found, though not
published till after the Epodes, must have been composed
within the period to which the latter are assigned.

The defects or shortcomings of Horace as a poet are, like
those of all original writers, intimately connected with his
peculiar merits. His strong good sense, and that which may
be called the Qd in his views¹
both of life and art, while they serve to secure to him so un-
rivalled a popularity among men of the world, not only deter
him from the metaphysical speculation which would have
been not less wearisome to „the larger portion of his readers
than distasteful to himself, as appertaining to those regions
beyond the province of the human mind, “at which Jove
laughs to see us outstretch our human cares,’'-—but rarely
permit him to plumb very far into the deeps of feeling and
passion. Marvellously as he represents the human nature
we have all of us in common, each thoughtful man has yet .
in him a something of human nature peculiar to himself,
which, like the goal of the Olympian charioteer, is some-
times almost grazed, but ever shunned, by the rapid wheels
of the Venusian.

It may also be said that his turn for irony² or his defer-
ence to the impatient taste of a worldly audience, while
serving to keep the attention always pleased, and contributing
so largely to his special secrets in art, sometimes shows itself
