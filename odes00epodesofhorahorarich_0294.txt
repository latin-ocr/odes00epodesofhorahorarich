Then seeks to allure him by tales
Teaching Iessons for sinning in safety:

All in vain 1 To his words is thy true—love
Deaf as rocks to the breakers Icarian 3
But keep sharp look-out on thyself,
Lest too charmed with thy neighbour Enipeus ;

Though no rider so skilled and so noticed
Wheels a steed on the turs of the Campus 3 ἦ
No swimmer so lustily cleaves
Rapid way down the stream of the Tuscan.

Make thy door fast at eve, never looking
Down the street if shrill fifes serenade thee 3
And be but more rigidly cold
Whensoe'er he complains of thy coldness.

circle. —MACLEANFL
