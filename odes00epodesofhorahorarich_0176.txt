128 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Now, now, thou strik’st the ear with murmurous threat
From choral horns—now the loud clarions blare ; ’
Lightnings from armour flashed,
Daunt charging war-steeds ⁹⁵ and the looks of men 1

Now, now, I seem to hear the mighty chiefS,
Soiled with the dust which ornaments the brave‚

And see all earth subdued‚
Save the intrepid soul of Cato, Foiled

Of her revenge, Juno, with all the gods,
Quitting the Afric they had loved in vain,
Back to Jugurtha’s shade
Brought funeral victims in his conqueror’s sons,

What field, made fertile by the Roman's gore,
Attests not impious wars by ghastly mounds,
And by the crash, borne far ’
To Median ears, of falling Italy?

What guli} what stream, has boomed not with the wail
Of dismal battle-storms? What sea has hues

From Daunian oarnage pure,
What land has lacked the tribute of our blood ?

Hush, wayward Muse, nor, playful strains laid by,
Strive to recast the Cean⁷s† dirge-like hymn 3
In Dionaean grot,
With me, seek measures tuned to lighter quill.

*⁸ “ Fugaces terret equos.’' “Fugaces’' here does not mean steeds
in flight, but rather in charge—it applies to their swiftness.——POR-
PHYRION. Orelli adopts that interpretation.

'l‘ “ Ceae—neniae.'’ Horace does not confine this word to the usual
sense of a dirge3 but it suits the quality of Simonides’s poetry, which
was of a severe and melancholy cast.—-MACLEANE.
