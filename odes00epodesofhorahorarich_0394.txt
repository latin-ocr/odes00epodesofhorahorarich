ODE ΙΙ.

ΤΟ IULUS ANTONIUS.

Iulus Antonius was the second son of M. Antony the
triumvir by Fulvia 3 the elder, Antyllus, was put to death by
Octavian after the battle of Actium. Iulus, then in his
infancy, was brought up with great tenderness by his step-
mother Octavia, married her daughter Marcella, and rose to
the highest honours of the State—praetor, A.U.c. 741 3 con—
sul, A.U.c. 744. His end was tragical. He was either
executed by Augustus or destroyed himself, A.U.C. 752, in
the forty-second year of his age, on the charge of adultery
with Julia, to which crime he is said to have been induced
by ambitious designs on the Empire. Iulus possessed the
literary accomplishments for which so many of the Roman
nobles in that day were remarkable. He was a pupil of L.
Crassitius, a celebrated grammarian, at whose school were
instructed youths of the first Roman families. γ According to
the scholiasts, he composed not only works in prose, but
twelve books in heroic verse upon Diomed, which Acron
styles “egregios 3⁷⁷ though, as Macleane observes with his
customary good sense, “As it is most likely Acron never

saw
Iulus, he who would with Pindar vie,
Soars, with Daedalian art, on waxen wings,
And falling, gives his name unto the bright
Deeps of an ocean.⁹⁶

As from the mountain-top a headlong stream,

Nourished by rains beyond familiar banks,

So seethes‚ and, measureless with utterance deep,
Rushes down Pindar.

 

⁴⁹ As Icarus gave his name to the Icarian sea.
