BOOK 11.-—ODE x. 161

melancholy interest as that of a foreboding. He was put to
death despite the intercession of Maecenas and Proculeius,
on the charge, whether true or false, of having entered with
Fannius Coepio and others into a conspiracy against Au-
gustus, As his death occurred A.U.c. 732, this ode must
have been composed before that date. Dio speaks of the
unrestrained licence he allowed to his tongue‚ and his words

may have incriminated him more than his actions, the guilt
of which Dio leaves doubtful.

CARM. X.

Rectius vives, Licini, neque altum

Semper urgendo, neque, dum procellas

Cautus horrescis, nimium premendo
Litus iniquum.

Auream quisquis mediocritatem

Diligit, tutus caret obsoleti

Sordibus tecti, caret invidenda
Sobrius aula.

Saepius ventis agitatur ingens

Pinus, et celsae graviore casu

Decidunt turres, feriuntque summos
Fulgura montes,

Sperat infestis, metuit secundis

Alteram sortem bene praeparatum

Pectus. Informes hiemes reducit
Juppster, idem

Summovet. Non, si male nunc, et olim
Sic erit ε quondam cithara tacentem
Suscitat Musam, neque semper arcum

Tendit Apollo.
