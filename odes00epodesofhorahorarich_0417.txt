Pacatum volitant per mare navitae,†
Culpari metuit Fides,

Laudantur simili prole puerperae,

Quis Parthum paveat? quis gelidum Scythen?
Quis Germania quos horrida parturit
Fetus, incolumi Caesare? quis ferae

of Maecenas—which Macleane rightly dismisses as mere gossip. It is
pretty clear, by these verses, either that Horace had heard of no such
scandal, or that both he and Maecenas regarded it with contempt. A
poet of so exquisite a taste, and so consummate a knowledge of the
world, would not have ventured on the line, “Nullis polluitur casta
domus stupris,’' if such scandal were rise at that very time, or, at least,
if any credit were attached to it 3 for thus the compliment would have
been turned into a bitter irony against Augustus, and a cruel insult to
Maecenas.

ἓ Literally “ at his second course ;'' or rather, as we should say, ‘⁴ at
dessert''—“ alteris mensis.'' By a decree of the Senate, libations were
to be offered to Octavian after the battle of Actium at private tables as
well as in public banquets, and his name to be inscribed in hymns of
praise as those of the gods.—D10N. CASS„ 1. 1·19. It is to these
national honours that Horace alludes whenever he speaks os Augustus
as enrolled among the gods.
