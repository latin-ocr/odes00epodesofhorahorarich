338 THE oDEs OF HORACE.

Pure from all taint let airs and dews of heaven ·
Nourish the new-born life.

Mild‚ all thine arrows S'heathed within the quiver,

Hear thy boy-suppliants, merciful Apollo ᾖ

Hear thy girl-votaries, crescent-crowned Luna,
Queen of the clustered starS.

If Rome be your work—if beneath your safeguard

A band of wanderers, Ilion’s scanty remnant,

Ordained to change their city and their LareS,
Have held this Tuscan land—-

They, unto whom, through Troy that blazed unharming,
Pure—souled AEneas, his lost land's survivor,
Opened free path, and heritage more ample

Than aught relinquished gave 3

Gods, grant to docile youth worth's upright manners-—

Gods‚ grant to placid age worth's calm contentment—

Grant to the Roman race growth‚ power, and richeS,†
And all that can adorn ἒ

Bless him who nears with milk-white Steers your altars,
Whose blood flows bright from Venus and Anchises;
Still every foe in battle may he conquer,

And after ¹conquest spare.

Awed by our arms, and by the Alban lictorS,‡
Now the Mede owns our power on land and ocean 3
Now Ind and Scythia, she of late so haughty‚

To Rome for pardon sue.§

ἱ This line seems to refer to the new statue of the Apollo of Actium
set up by Augustus in the Palatine temple. In the Apollo of Actium
invoked by Augustus before his battle with M. Antony, the bow is bent
—in the Apollo of the Palatine the bow is laid aside for the lyre and
plectrum.—-See MACLEANE’S excellent note on this line.
