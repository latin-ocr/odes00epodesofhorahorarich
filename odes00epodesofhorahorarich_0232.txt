184 'THE oDEs oF HORACE.

O D E XVII.

TO MAECENAS.

This ode is addressed to Maecenas in illness, but the date
of the illness is necessarily uncertain in the life of a vale·
tudinarian like Maecenas. Though‚ as Macleane observes,
the last two lines of this ode, showing that Horace had.
not yet paid the sacrifice he had vowed to Faunus for his

preservation from death, makes it most probable that it was
written not long after C. 13 of this book, the composition of

which has been assigned, with some hesitation, to A.U.c. 728.
Maecenas was subject to what appears to have been a low
nervous sever, attended with loss of sleep. According to the
verses attributed to him, andv censured with a stoic’s lofty
disdain by Seneca (Epp. 101), Maecenas had apassionate
and clinging desire for life, very uncommon in a Roman,
deeming that, under any suffering or infirmity, life was still

dear—
“ Vita

Why destroyest thou me with the groan of thy sufferings ?
Neither I nor the gods will let thee die before me,
O Maecenas, the glory and grace
And the column itself, of my life.

Ah 1 if some fatal force, prematurely bereaving,
Wrenched from me the one half of my soul, could the other

Linger on, with its dearer part lost,
And the fragment of what was a whole?

No 1 in thy life is mine 3 both, the same day shall shatter.
I have made no false vow 3 where thou lead'st me I follow 3
Fellow-travellers, the same solemn road
We will take, we will take, side by side.
