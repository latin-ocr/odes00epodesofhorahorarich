366 THE onEs OF HORACE.

ODE V.

TO AUGUSTUS, THAT HE WOULD HASTEN HIS RETURN
ΤΟ ROME.

This ode, which Dillenburger rightly calls “ dulcissimum
carmen,’' may be taken in connection with the preceding
and with Ode xiv. It was composed during the absence
of Augustus in Germany and Gaul, and after the victories
of Tiberius and Drusus, Augustus had been absent from
September A.U.C. 738 to February 741. In the description
of the blessings ascribed to the reign of Augustus, the se-
curity to life and property, the reformation of the previous

licence
Best guardian of the race of Romulus,
And sprung thyself from deities benign,
Absent too long, fulfil thy promise, pledged
To Rome’s high court ⁹⁶—return.

Bring to thy country back, beloved chief,

The light : thy looks are to thy people Spring,

And where they smile, more grateful glides the day,
More genial shines the sun.

As the fond mother with all passionate prayers

Calls back the son more than one year away,

By adverse winds beyond Carpathian seas
Kept from sweet home afar,

F ixing intent upon the curving shore
The unmoving stillness of her wistful eyes 3—
So for her Caesar, smit with faithful love,

His country looks and pines.
