330 THE ODES OF HORACE.

THE SECULAR HYMN.

Religious games, called Ludi Tarentini, Terentini, or
Taurii, had been held in Rome from an early period of the
Republic. Their origin is variously stated, though the most
probable mythical accounts agree that they were instituted
and devoted to Dis and Proserpina in consequence of a
fearful plague—whether by one Valerius in gratitude for the
recovery of his three children, or in the reign of Tarquinius
Superbus in order to propitiate those formidable deities. In
the latter case the plague had affected pregnant women, and
their children died in the womb 3 and sterile cows (Taureae)
being sacrificed, the games were called Ludi Taurii. By
these accounts it would seem that the games were connected
with the health of offspring, and by all accounts that they
were instituted in honour of Dis and Proserpina. To those
eminent scholars who hold to the Etrurian origin of the
Tarquins, “the Tarenti and Taurii are but as different forms
of the same word, and of the same root as Tarquinius '’
(Smith's Dict., art. “Ludi Saeculares⁷'). If so, the deities hon-
oured were doubtless Etrurian—not Greek nor Roman—-
though the Romans subsequently identified them with divini-
ties familiar to their own worship.

Be that as it may, during the Republic these games appear
to have been only celebrated three times, at irregular intervals
in no way connected with fixed periods or cycles (saecula).

When Augustus had completed (A.U.C. 737) the second
lustre, or the ten years for which the imperial power was
first confided to him, it was very natural that he should wish
for the solemnity of an extraordinary festival at once popular
and religious, and probably also the desire of establishing a
dynasty would give rise to the idea of rendering this solem-
nity regular, but at far-distant dates 3 thus associating in-
directly the duration of the Empire with the welfare and ex-
, istence of Rome. The custodiers of the Sibylline books,
