352 THE ODES OF HORACE.

His frontal imitates the curv'e'd gleam
Of the young moon in her third night 3—all else

Of tawny colour‚ on that front of snow
Shimrners her signet*

'¹' The conclusion of the ode has been, plausibly enough, blamed for
a discrepancy amounting to bathos between the gravity and elevation of
the preceding stanzas, and the familiar details of the steerling to be
sacrificed—“Desinit in vitulum mulier formosa superne '' (STEINER).
Orelli, on the contrary, thinks it conformable to poetic art, that the
’ height of enthusiasm should subside, as it were, in the placid anticipa-
tion of the destined sacrifice. Possibly Horace> meant also, in describ·
ing the animal so minutely as already reserved for the sacrifice, to imply
how eagerly expected was the return of Augustus 3-——the victims were
already marked, the preparations already made.
