Sed quid Typhoeus et validus Mimas,

Quid RhoetuS, evulsisque truncis

Pallas to whom the victory is mainly owing, otherwise the force of his
argument is lost.’⁷ But, as is said in the introduction, Horace appears
to me to have desired emphatically, though symbohcally, to intimate the

the cause of Augustus—Vulcan, the representative of industry—-Juno,
,Of social order and marriage—Apollo, of arts and letters. This sup-
position is in accordance with the soeial or politieal objects to which
these odes are devoted, and with the special benefits which Horace else-
where ascribes to the reign of Augustus.
