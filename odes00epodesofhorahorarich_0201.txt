was—and may possibly be an adaptation from Βαρῖνος, a kind

assumption of some commentators that Horace himself was
in love with Barine, whoever she waS. Judging by internal
evidence, it seems to me that a real person was certainly
thus addressed, and in a tone which to such a person would
have been the most exquisite flattery 3 and as certainly that
the person is not so addressed by a lover.

CARM. VIII.

Ulla si juris tibi pejerati

Poena, Barine, nocuisset unquam,

Dente si nigro fieres vel uno '
Turpior ungui,

Crederem. Sed tu, simul obligasti

Perfidum votis caput, enitescis

Pulchrior multo, juvenumque prodis
Publica cura.

Expedit matris cineres opertos

Fallere, et toto taciturna noctis

Signa cum caelo, gelidaque divos
¹ Morte carentes

Ridet hoc, inquam, Venus ipsa, rident
Simplices N ymphae,÷÷ ferus et Cupido
Semper ardentes acuens sagittas

Cote cruenta.
