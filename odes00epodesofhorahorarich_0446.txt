398 THE ODEs OF HORACE.

ODE XIII.
To LYCE‚' A FADED BEAUTY.

No subject of inquiry can be less interesting to a critic of
good sense than that on which so many learned disputants
have wasted their time—viz., who among the ladies cele-
brated by Horace were real persons or imaginary3 and who
are to be admitted into or rejected from the genuine cata-
logue of his loves? We have absolutely no data to go
upon. There *is no reason, except that he chooses to apply
the same name to both, to suppose that the Lyce over whose
ruined charms he now exults was the Lyce of whose cruelty
he complains, Lib. III. Od. x.; nay, Ι believe that most

recent scholars are pretty well agreed that the ode last
mentioned was an artistic exercise‚ imitated from the Greek

serenades.

They have heard my prayers, Lyce, vthe gods 3
The gods have heard, Lyce 3 thou‘rt old,
Yet still, Setting up for a beauty‚
Thou wouldst tipple and frisk with the young3

Courting, maudlin, with tremulous chant,
Laggard Cupid: he's absent on guard
O'er the bloom on the cheeks of young Chia,
Whose lute is more sweet than thy song.9⁶

For he roosts not on oaks without sap 3
Hollow teeth and dry wrinkles he flieS,
He is chilled by the snow of grey tresses,
And thus has retreated from thee.

⁴* There is an opposition between Lyce's tremulous quaver, “cantu
tremulo‚'' and Chia’s musical skill, “ doctae psallere,” which can only,
perhaps, be made clear by some slight paraphrase‚ as is attempted in the
last line of the stanza, in translation.
