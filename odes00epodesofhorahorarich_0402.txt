354 THE oDEs oF HORACE.

ODE III.

TO MELPOMENE.

The sweetness and dignity of this ode have been a theme
of unqualified praise to the critics. It was evidently written
after the Secular Hymn, which gave authority and sanction
to Horace's claim to be “ Romanae fidicen, lyrae.’'

W hom thou, Melpomene,

Hast once with still bright aspect marked at birthj'*
On him no Isthmian toils

Shall shed the lustre of an athlete’s fame 3

Him shall no fiery steed
Ravish to victory in Achaian car,

In him no warlike deeds
Shall, from the hill-top of the Capitol,†

Show to a world's applause

The glorious image of a conquering chief,
With Delian leaves adorned,

Who crushed'the swelling menaces of kings 3

Yet him shall streams that flow

Through fertile Tibur, and the thick- -grown lock's
Of the green forest· -kings,

Endow with lordship—in AEolian song.

Me have the sons of Rome,
Sovereign of cities, deigned to enrol amidst

The choir beloved of bards 3
And now even Envy bites with milder fang.

⁴* “Nascentem placido lumine videris.'’ The image here is taken
from astrology. To Melpomene is ascribed the influence of the planet
ascendant at birth, and by which, in technical terms, the “ Native’' (or
new-born) is ‘⁴ aspected. ’‘
