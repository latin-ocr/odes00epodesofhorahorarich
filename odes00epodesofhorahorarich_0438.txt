³390 THE -oDEs OF HORACE.

oDE XI.-

TO PHYLLIS.

As Horace had before (Lib. III. Od. xxviiiss) invited Lyde

the women they woo that she shall be the last love. To those
who insist upon giving literal individual personality to the
fictitious names Horace introduces into his poems, this poem

And all hands are at work 3 here and there run the servants,
Men and maids, helter-skelter 3 the flame mounts in flicker,
