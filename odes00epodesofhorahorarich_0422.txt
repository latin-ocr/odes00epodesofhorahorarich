374 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Pledged to AEneas by his solemn nod
Walls more auspiciOUS.

Tuneful Thalia’s sovereign melodist,

Laving in Xanthian waves thy golden hair,

Support the honour of the Daunian Muse,
Beardless Agyieus 1⁹⁶

Phoebus on me bestowed the soul, on me
The art of song, on me the poet’s name.

† O noblest virgins, and O ye young sons
Of noble fathers,

Wards of the Delian goddess with her bow

striking the ssight of stags and lynxes still,

The Lesbianss measure timed and tuned by me,
Guard unforgetful‚

Chanting‚ with ritual due, Latona’s son,

And her who kindles night with crescent beam,

Prospers the harvestS‚ and the sliding months
Speeds in their circle.

Say, maid, then wedded,§ “ In that hallowed year

Which did the secular feast-lights reillume,

Song dear to gods I sang—song taught by him,
Horace the poet.⁷'

 

ὕ The name of Agyieus seems here very appropriately invoked, be-
cause Apollo takes that name from the Greeks, as presiding over the
thoroughfares of cities, “quasi viis praepositus urbanis;’' and all the
streets of Rome would have been alive with the festival and processions
connected with the Secular Hymn which the ode re'fers tO.

† Here Horace turns to the chorus of the Secular Hymn.

ss “ Lesbium servate pedem, meique
Pollicis ictum.'’
By “pollicis ictum” is meant the motion of the thumb in marking tho

rhythm or time of the song, not the striking of the lyre.
