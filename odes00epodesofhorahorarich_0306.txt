258 THE oDEs OF HORACE.

Yet, granting thy heart be not soster than oak,
Nor gentler than snakes—as a goddess, at least,
Spare the life of a suppliant 1 I am of flesh‚
And can bear not for ever this porch and that sleet.⁹⁵

 

ὕ “ Aquae Caelestis patiens.'’ The expression can scarcely apply to

rain, since the night has been described as one of wind and frost :—
⁴⁴ Glaciet nives
Puro numine Juppiter;’'

“ puro'’ being, as Macleane observes, “ an epithet well suited to a
clear, frosty night.” The wind would keep off the snow, but there
might be gusty showers of sleety hail. Horace, however, no doubt,
uses the expression in a general sense, such as the ‘⁶ floods of heaven‚'’
whether they be snow, rain, or sleet.
