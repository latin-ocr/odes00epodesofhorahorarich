150 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Give to Jove, then, the feast that thou ow’st to his mercy 3
Worn with warfare so lengthened rest under my laurel,
Nor will Ι allow thee to spare
The casks Ι have destined for thee.

Ho, slaves, brim the cups,÷÷ Egypt's cups smooth and wide-
li ed,
With thepslifft Massic wine which lulls care in oblivion 3
Pour sweets from large shells. Who the first
Fresh parsley or myrtle will twine Ρ

Whom will Venus† befriend in the cast for our wine-king Ρ-
As for me, I'm prepared to out-tipple a Thracian z
Ah, how sweet to drown reason in joy,
For the friend whom I welcome once more Ξ

⁴* “ Ciboria‚'' cups shaped like the pod of the Egyptian bean. “Ore
superius lato, inferius angust0.'’—ORELL1.

Ἰ· “Quem Venus arbitrum dicet bibendi.'' Venus was the highest
throw on the'dice, Canis the lowest.
