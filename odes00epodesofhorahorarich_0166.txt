118 THE onEs OF HORACE.

ODE XXXVI.

oN NUMIDA'S RETURN vFROM SPAIN.

Horace congratulates Numida on his return from Spain—-
probably from the army with Augustus, A.U.C. 730. Who
Numida was can be only matter of conjecture.

Repay both with incense and harp-string‚

Repay with the heifer’s blood due, N umida's guardians divine 3
Safe back from Hesperia the farthest,

Now among loving friends shares he many a brotherly kiss,

But the portion of Lamia is largest ς

Mindful of childhood subjected to the same monarch'sss
, control,

And how they both, donning the toga,
Leapt into manhood together. Let not this happy day lack

The registered mark of the Crete stone ι
Be there no stint to the wine-cask‚ be there no pause to
the feet,
Blithe in the bound of such measure
Salii on holidays dance to l Bassus shall gallantly vie

With Damalis, queen of she—topers,
Toss off his cup with a swallow like the grand drinkers of ‘
Thrace ;†
And banquets shall want not the roses,
Garlands of parsley the long-lived, garlands of lilies the brief.

All eyes shall for Damalis languish 3
But yet more encirclin g than ivy, climbing its way as it winds,
Shall Damalisgproof to their glauces,
Turning aside from the old loves, cling root and branch
to the new.

without drawing breath.
