32 THE ODES OF HORACE.

O D E VIII.
To LYDIA.

This ode has been paraphrased by Henry Luttrell into
that elegant and playful satire upon the manners of his own
day, called ‘ Advice to Juliaff The names are clearly ficti-

tiouS.
By all the godS‚ Lydia, O say, I implore,
Why must love hurry Sybaris into perdition?
Why to him once so patient of dust and of sun
Has the Campus become so detestably sultry?

Why with those of his age rides that hero no more,
Curbing mouths fresh from Gaul* with a bit like a wolf-
fan ?
Why afraidg yellow Tiber to touch ? Why the oil
Of the athlete more shunned than the froth of the viper?

Why in triumph no longer displays he that arm

Which in black and in blue bore the signs of his prowess ?
Ah, how often by disk or by dart beyond bound

Has that arm to its owner brought noble distinction !

Where lurks he concealed‚ as they tell us lurked once,
Kept from Troy' 5 tearful funerals, the son of sea· Thetis,
Lest to Lycian hosts, slaughter, and doom, hurried off,
If the habit of manhood proclaimed him Achilles?

 

* “ Gallica nec lupatis
Temperat ora frenis.”
Gallie mouths—horses from Gaul. These were considered very high
mettled‚ but, when well broken-in, so serviceable in war that they were
in great request in the Roman cavalry. ‘⁶ LupatiS,'’ a bit, jagged like
wolves' teeth. ι
