292 THE ODES OF· HORACE.

ODE XXII.
vo‘rivn INSCRIPTION To DIANA.

Nothing more need be said of this ode than that it is one
of the votive inscriptions common among the ancients, and
that a pine-trec would be very fittingly dedicated to Diana.
The attempts made to extract a story out of the occasion
and the offering are preposterous. That which is chiefly
noticeable in this and other poems by Horace, more or less
similar, is the rare and admirable merit of terseness. The
poet has sufficient reliance on himself to be sure that, how-
ever briefly and simply he expresses himself on a subject to
which brevity and simplicity belong, his unmistakable mark
will appear on the work. ⁵

Guardian of mountain-peakS, and forests—-Virgin‚

Goddess triformed-who, thrice invoked, benignly

Dost hear young mothers in their hour of travail,
And from death save them 3

Thine be this pine which overhangs my villa,
To which each closing year shall be devoted>

A youthful boar, of sidelong thrusts indulging
Vain meditations.
