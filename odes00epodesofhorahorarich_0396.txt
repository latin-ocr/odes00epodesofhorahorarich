ΤΗΕ ODES OF HORACE.

All due to him Apollo‘s· laureate crown, ,

Whether through daring dithyrambs he roll

Language new-formed* borne on the lawless wave
Of his wild music ;

Whether he sing of gods or god-born kings,

By whom the Centaurs with just doom were slain,

And dire Chimaera's flame was quenched 3 or those
Palm-crowned in Elis,

Led as Celestials horne 3 and chants the strife

Of steed or cestus 3 offering gists, o'er time

More potent than a hundred monuments
Wrought from the marble 3

Or wails the youth snatched from a weeping bride,
And, in lamenting, lifts his force of souI,
Valour, and golden worth, unto the stars,

Foiling black Orcus.

Ample the gale which buoys the Theban swan,
Oft as he seeks his altitude in clouds.
Ι, like the bee of the Matinian hill,

Gather the wild—thyme,

With lavish labour hiving thrifty sweets ;

Lowly‚ by Tibur’s grove and dewy banks,

I seek the honey that I store in song,†
Kneaded with labour.

But thou, the minstrel of a grander lyre,
Celebrate Caesar, when his laurelled brow

 

‘ Nova verba,'’ “ new forms of expression.”

“Carmina fingo.” “ Fingo” corresponds to ’(πλάττω,” which

word the Greeks used especially with reference to the making of honey.
