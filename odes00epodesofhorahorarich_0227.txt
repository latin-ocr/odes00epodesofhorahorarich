CARM. XV.

Jam pauca aratro jugera regiae
Moles relinquent: undique latius
Extenta visentur Lucrino
Stagna lacu ε platanusque caeIebs,

Evincet ulmos: tum violaria et
Myrtus et omnis copia narium,
Spargent olivetis odorem

Fertilibus domino priori 3

Tum spissa ramis laurea fervidos
Excludet ictus. Non ita Romuli
Praescriptum et intonsi Catonis
Auspiciis, veterumque norma.

Privatus illis census erat brevis,
Commune magnum z nulla decempedis
Metata privatis opacam
Porticus excipiebat Arcton 3*

Nec fortuitum spernere caespitem
Leges sinebant, oppida publ-ico
Sumptu jubentes et deorum
Templa nova decorare saxo.

⁴* “Nulla decempedis
Metata privatis opacam
Porticus excipiebat Arcton.”
No private man had porticoes measured bya ten-feet rule, which appears
to have been a measurement for temples and public buildings. The
, peristyles at Pompeii, which form an inner court to the house, give
sufficient idea of these corridors, opening to the north for coolness
in summer, and to the south sor sunshine in winter.
