ODE VIII.

TO BARINE.

Some of the MSS.7 upon what authority is unknown, pre-
fix Julia to Barine. Bentley obJects to the name as being
neither Greek nor Latin. Orelli shrewdly suggests that
there were plenty of gay ladies at Rome who were of other
nations besides Greece and Rome. The name, however, is

very

If for thy vows forsworn the least infliction ”
Came from the gods 3 were one white tooth less pearl—like,
One very nail less rosy, then, Barine,

Ι might believe thee.

But in proportion as that head perfidious

Thou doom'st to Orcus, brighter shines thy beauty,

And grows still more the universal theme of
Youthful adorerS.

Clearly with thee it prospers to be perjured ε ¹
Oaths “ by a mother's urn‚⁷' “ night’s starry silence,''

“ All heaven,’' “the deathless gods,'’ obtain thee blessings
Only when broken.

At all this treason Venus laughs‚ then? laugh out
The very nymphsj* so truthful, and fieree Cupid‚
Sharpening his fiery arrows on a whetstone‚

Red with men's heart-blood.
