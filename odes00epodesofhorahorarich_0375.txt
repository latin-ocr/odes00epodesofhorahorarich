fame. It is unnecessary to defend Horace here from the
charge of vainglory, to which a modern poet, arrogating to
himself the immortality of fame, would be exposed. The
manners of an age decide the taste of an age. The heathen
poets spoke of the immortality of their verses with as little
scruple as Christian poets speak of the immortality of their
souls. Not to mention the Greek poets, Dillenburger gives
a tolerably long list of passages from the Latin—Ennius,
Virgil, Propertius, Ovid, Martial—who spoke of their con-
quest over time with no less confidence than Horace here
does. The metre in the original is the same as that of
Ode i. Book I., which perhaps strengthens the supposition

that the poem is designed to complete a collection which
that ode commenced.

month, go up to the Capitol to offer sacrifices to Vesta, her virgins
walking solemnly in *the procession, as they did, while the boys sang

hymns in honour of the goddess. With a Roman this was equivalent
to saying ‘ for ever.' ''—MACLEANE.
