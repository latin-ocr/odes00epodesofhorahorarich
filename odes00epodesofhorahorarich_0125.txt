BOOK L—ODE XXI. 77

727, and therefore after the first celebration of the Actian
gameS. The other objectionis in the nature of the poem
itself‚ which, as Orelli remarkS, is of too light a quill for the
ceremonial pomp of solemn games or earnest supplication.
The reference to the Persians and Britons at the close
would seem to intimate the same date as the 29th Ode of
this Book, when Augustus was preparing a military expedi-
tion against Briton and the East‚ viz. , A. U.O. 727. The notion
of Sanadon, that the ode was an introduction to the Saecular
Hymn, has long been exploded.
