250 THE ODES OF HORACE.

SubJ‘ect to Rome, and curbed in tardy setters‚

The old Cantabriam foe on shores Hispaniam ;

Lo! the grim Scythians meditate retreating—
Lax are their bow-strings.

As one who takes in private life his leisure‚

A while forego the over-care for nations 3

Leave things severe 3 life offers one glad moment—
Seize it with gladness.
