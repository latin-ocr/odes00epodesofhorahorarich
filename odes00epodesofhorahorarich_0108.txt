RECANTATION.

There is no ground for safe conJecture as to the person
here addressed. The old inscriptions applying it to Tyn-
daris, the daughter of Gratidia, celebrated as Canidia in
the Epodes, or the assertion in Cruquius that it is Grati-
dia herself, are now generally considered to be purely fic-

t1tlous.

O, of mother so fair thou the yet fairer daughter,
To such end as thou wilt put my guilty iambics,
Fling them into the flames to consume,

Or the ocean of Hadria to drown.

Phrygian Cybele, no, nor the Pythian Apollo ·
In the innermost shrines soul-convulsing his priesthood‚
No, nor Liber, nor Corybants mad
When their cymbals redouble the clash,

Craze the mind like the woeful disorders of anger,
Which are scared from their vent, nor by Norican falchion,
Wreckful oceans——untameable fires,
Nor ev’n Jove though himself thunder down.

It is said that Prometheus to man's primal matter ,
Was compelled to add something from each living creature,
And thus from the wild lion he took
Rabid virus to place in our gall.

Anger shattered in ruins the House of Thyestes 3
Anger stands forth the cause by which cities have perished,
And the ploughshare of insolent hosts
Has passed over the site of their walls,
