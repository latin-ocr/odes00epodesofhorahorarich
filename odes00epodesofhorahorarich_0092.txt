44 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XII.

IN CELEBRATION OF THE DEITIES AND THE
WORTHIES OF ROME.

This poem is commonly inscribed very inappropriately
“ De Augusto‚’' and sometimes more accurately ‘² De laudi-

bus

What man, what hero, or what god select'st thou,

Theme for sweet lyre or fise sonorous, Clio Ρ

Whose honoured name shall that gay sprite—voice‚ Eeho,
Hymn back rebounding‚

Whether on Helicon's umbrageous margent,

Whether on heights of Pindus or cold Haemus,

Whenee woods, at random, vocal Orpheus followed?
He who stayed rivers

In their swift course, and winds in their wild hurry

By art maternal 5³⁶ and with bland enchantment

Led the huge oaks at his melodious pleasure
List’ning his harp-strings.

Whom should I place for wonted rites of homage

Before the Father-King of gods and mortals‚

Who earth, and ocean, and heaven's varying seasons†
Orders and tempers,

From whom not greater than Himself proceedeth-
To whom exists no semblanee and no second?
Yet where he hath a nearest, be its honours

Sacred to Pallas.

 

³* “Arte materna”—the Muse Calliope, mother of Orpheus.

† “ Qui mare ae terras variisque mundum
Temperat horis.”
“ Mundum '' here means “ eoelum,'' ‘⁴ sky’'--i.e., the whole framework
of nature, in sea, earth, and heaven, is under the dominion of Jove.
