‡ “Omne capax movet urna nomen.'’ ..The image is taken from the
use of the dice, so familiar to the Romans. Fate is represented as hold-
ing the urn which contains the lots of all men. This she keeps shaking
(as we shake or rattle the dice-box), and casts out the lots indifferently.

ἓ “Non avium citharaeque cantus.” It must not be supposed that
the natural song of the wild bird out of doors is here meant. Horace is
speaking of artificial luxuries in contradistinction to the banks and vales
of the following stanza, to which the song of the wild bird would apply.
Here he means the singing-birds which the Romans kept in aviaries
within their houses. Their notes, and the sound of distant music, and
the trickling of water, were among the artificial means for soothing the
nerves and inducing sleep‚ practised by the luxurious. Maecenas, who
suffered from insomnia during that kind of nervous depression which
saddened his later years, is said by Seneca to have endeavoured to lull
himself to sleep by the aid of distant music. It is not to Maecenas, how-
ever, that Horace here alludes, sor such an allusion in this place would
have been an unfeeling affront.
