BOOK II.—-oDE XVIII. 189

It abounds in trochees, I can only attempt to give a
general idea of its trippingness and brevity of sound. It
treats, with more than usual beauty, Horace’s favourite thesis
of declamation against the grasping nature of avarice 3 and,
as Dillenburger observeS, it takes up and expands the senti-
ment with which he had closed Ode xvi.

ΙΙ CARM. XVIII.

Non ebur neque aureurn

Premunt columnas ultima recisas

Ignotus heres regiam occupavi 3
Nec Laconicas miffi -

Trahunt honestae purpuras clientae.‡

At fides et ingeni

Benigna vena est, pauperemque dives
Me petit3 nihil supra

Deos lacesso, nec potentem amicum

Largiora flagito,

Satis beatus unicis Sabinis.
Truditur dies die,

Novaeque pergunt interire Lunae :

Attalus did not know the persons he enriched. Torrentius supposes
the lines to refer to Aristonicus, who, after the death of Attalus, seized
on the throne by false pretences, defeated Licinius Crassus, was after-
wards conquered by Perpenna, carried to Rome, and strangled in prison
by orders of the Senate. The former interpretation is preferable.

,ἶ “ ‘ Honestae clientae.' I have seen no satisfactory explanation of
the words ‘ honestae clientae.' Mr Long has suggested to me that they
may refer to the rustic women on a man's farms—the wives of the
Coloni.”—MACLEANE.
