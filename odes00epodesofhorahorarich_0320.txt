272 ΤΗΕ ODES OF HORACE.

Go, and bid silver-tongued Neaera hasten,
Binding in Spartan knot her looks myrrh-scented 3 κ·
But, if obstructed by that brute her porter‚·

Quietly come back.

Nothing cools fiery spirits like a grey hair 3

In every quarrel 'tis your sure peacemaker 3

In my hot youth, when Plancus was the consul, ·
· I was less patient.†

 

 

⁴* “,Myrrheum crinem.'’ The scholiasts interpreted this expression
“ myrrh-eoloured.'' Orelli and other recent commentators support the
interpretation “ myrrh-scented.’'

-Ι- I. e.‚ when Horace was in his twenty-third year.
