BOOK 111.—0DE xrx. 285

B.c. 23. In B.c. 22 he was involved in the conspiracy of
Fannius Caepio against the life of AugustuS, and, though
his guilt seems doubtful, executed. This is the same per-
son whom Horace addresses under the name Licinius,
Book II. Ode x., “ Rectius vives Licini,’‘ &c. The metre
in the original is the second Asclepiadean3 but I have
found it easier to preserve fidelity to the sense and spirit of
the poem by employing one of the varieties of rhythm which
Ι have appropriated to the Alcaic.

CARM. XIX.

Quantum distet ab Inacho

Quo praebente domurn et quota

Da Noctis mediae, da, puer, auguris

mixing-bowl to the drinking-cup. The ladle was of certain capacity,
and twelve ‘ cyathi' went to the Sextarius. Horace says, in effect, ‘ Let
the wine be mixed in the proportion of three cyathi of wine to nine of
water, or of nine of wine to three of water.' . . . ⁴ Commodis‚' ‘ fit
and p1·oper,'—‘ cyathi,’ that is, ‘ bumpers.’ ‘'—MACLEANE. The above
seems the best and most intelligible interpretation of a passage in which,
if conjectures were cyathi, the commentators would have greatly ex-
ceeded the number allowed to the nine Muses.
