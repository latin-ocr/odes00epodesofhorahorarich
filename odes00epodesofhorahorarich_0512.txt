464 THE EPODEs OF HORACE.

EPODE. XV.
To NEAERA.

This poem may have been an imitation of the Greek, but
as Horace ¹pointedly introduces his own name as that of the
complainant, it must be inserted that, at all eventS, he meant
to be understood as speaking in his own person. The pro-

bability

'Twas night—the moon shone forth in cloudless heaven
Amid the lesser stars,

When thou didst mock, in vows myself had taught thee,
The great presiding gods 3

Closer than round the ilex clings the ivy,
Clasping me with twined arms:

“ Long as the wolf shall prey upon the sheepfold—
Long as the seaman's foe,

Baleful Orion, rouse the wintry billows—
Or the caressing breeze

Ripple the unshorn ringlets of Apollo,
Our mutual love shall be l’'

Ah l thou shalt mourn to find me firm, Neaera 3
For if in Flaccus aught

Of man be left, he brooks not halved embraces 3
Stooped to no second rank,

His love shall leave thee, and explore its equal.
The beart, in which the pang

Of the last treason once makes sure its entry,
Is ever henceforth proof

To charms which perfidy has rendered hateful.
And thou, O happier one 1

Whoe’er thou art, in my defeat exusting,
Be rich in herds and lands 3
