84 THE oDEs OF HORACE.

ODE XXIV.
To VIRGIL ON THE DEATH OF QUINCT1L1US VARUS.

Quinctilius died A.U.C. 730. Little is known of him be-
, yond the mention with which he is immortalised by Horace.
In theArs Poetica he is spoken of as dead, and as having

been a frank and judiciously severe critic, who, if you trusted
your

What shame or what restraint unto the yearning

For one so loved? Music attuned to sorrow

Lead⁹⁵ thou, Melpomene, to whom the Father
Gave liquid voice and lyre.

So, the eternal slumber clasps Quinctilius,
Whose equal when shall shame-faced sense of Honour,

Incorrupt Faith, of Justice the twin sister,
Or Truth unveiled, find?

By many a good man wept, he died 3—-no mourner
Wept with tears sadder than thine own, O V irgil Ξ
Pious, alas, in vain! thou redemandest

Quinctilius from the gods 3

Not on such terms they lent him l—Were thy harp-strings
Blander than those by’which the Thracian Orpheus
Charmed listening forestS, never flows the life-blood

Back to the phantom form

Which Hermes, not reopening Fate's closed portal

At human prayer, amid the dark flock Shepherds

With ghastly rod. Hard 1 yet still Patience lightens
T hat which admits no cure.
