BOOK L—ODE 1x. 35

per name, it would have been unintelligible to those of his
readers who did not understand Greek 3 and to those who
did, would have appeared a pedantic affectation, which was
precisely the reproach that a man of Horace’s good taste
and keen sense of the ridiculous would not voluntarily have
incurred. The references to the manner in which Thaliar-
’ chus may spend his day, all belong to the life of a town3
and there is no reason to suppose the scene otherwise than
at Rome. Walckenaer says that the isolated and singular
form of Soracte strikes the eye on quitting the city by one
of the two gates to the north.

Though, to judge by a fragment preserved in Athenaeus, ’

the poem is more or less imitated from an ode by Alcaeus,
the scene and manners are altogether Roman 3 in fact, the
more the fragments left of Greek poets are fairly compared
with the⁸verses in which they are imitated by Horace, the
more Horace's originality in imitating becomes conspicuous

CARM. IX.

Vides, ut alta stet nive candidum
Soracte, nec jam sustineant onus
Silvae laborantes, geluque
Flumina constiterint acuto.

Dissolve frigus, ligna super foco
Large reponens3 atque benignius
Deffiffilfeffl 'quadrimum Sabina,

O Thaliarche, merum diota.

Permitte divis cetera, qui simul
Stravere ventos aequore fervido
Deproeliantes, nec cupressi

Nec veteres agitantur omi.
