THE EPQDES OF HORACE.

’ And as for”gold,· I give thee all Pactolus 3· ⁷

Know all the lore occult

Stored by Pythagoras re-born 3 in beauty
Nireus himself excel 3

And yet, alas'! in store for thee my sorrow,
Thou too wilt moum

Loves with such ease made over to another—-
My turn for mockery then Ξ
