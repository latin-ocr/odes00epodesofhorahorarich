CARM. XVII.

Jam jam efficaci do manus scientiae,
Supplex, et oro regna per Proserpinae,
Per et Dianae non movenda numina,

Per atque libros carminum valentium
Refixa caelo devocare sidera,

Canidia, parce vocibus tandem sacris,
Citumque retro solve, solve turbinem*
Movit nepotem Telephus N ere'1'um,†

In quem superbus ordinarat agmina
Mysorum, et in quem tela acuta torserat.
Unxere matres Iliae addictum feris
Alitibus atque canibus homicidam Hectorem,
Postquam relictis moenibus rex procidit
Heu l pervicacis ad pedes Achillei.
Setosa duris exuere pellibus

Laboriosi remiges Ulixei,

“ turbo,'' which means both a whirlwind and a spinning-top, probably
implies the shape of the witch’s wheel‚ as being wide at its upper part
(the hoop), and spira] at the bottom. Party-coloured threads attached
to it formed a web to entangle the victim operated upon.

'l‘ Telephus, king of Mysia, opposed the Greeks on their expedition
to Troy, was wounded by Achilles, grandson of Nereus, and son of
Thetis. Achilles cured him by the serapings of the spear with which
he was wounded.
