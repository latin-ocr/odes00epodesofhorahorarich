EPODE v. -’ 443

Sed dubius unde rumperet silentium,

ι Misit Thyesteas preces :⁹⁵

‘ Venena magnum fas nefasque non valent
Convertere humanam vicem 3

Diris agam vos 3 † dira detestatio
Nulla expiatur victima.

Quin, ubi perire jussus exspiravero,
Nocturnus occurram F uror,‡

Petamque voltus umbra curvis unguibus,
Quae vis deorum est Manium 3

Et inquietis assidens praecordiis,
Pavore somnos auferam.

Vos turba vicatim hinc et hinc saxis petens
Contundet obscoenas anus ;

candour, not less than nine various interpretations‚ but very decidedly
pronounces himself in favour of that which Ι believe he originates‚ and
which is certainly a bold one. He assumes “ magnum fas nefasque ” to
be the subject, and that the sense is, “the great law os wrong and right
(divinae leges), according to human sense (humanam vicem), cannot con-
vert (soften and bend) witchcraft or the hearts of witches.’' Macleane
says, I think correctly, “that if this view of the construction were
adopted, it would be better to render ‘humanam vicem' ‘ on behalf of
men or of humanity.' '’ Macleane suggests two other interpretations
(see his note), which appear to me more open to objection. Yonge,
following Orelli in the main points, asks whether it may not be better
to reverse the order, and take “ venena '² for the nominative case—thus,
“ sorceries (and those who use them) cannot change (z'.e.‚ turn aside or
defeat) the divine law, as they can men and men's law 3 therefore I
appeal to them : such an appeal will draw down a wrath implacable.''
He renders “humanam vicem '' “in human fashion‚’' “after the man·
ner of men.’' I have adopted the sense of this interpretation. Witch-
crafts is a better word here than sorceries‚ which properly signify divina·
tion by lot. Two other interpretations have been suggested to me by
eminent scholars : Ist, Witchcraft cannot distort (or overthrow) the
great rules of right and wrong in the interest of men (taking “human-
am vicem '' in the sense, “hominum causa''). 2d, Witchcraft can'not
overthrow the great law of wrong and right—human retribution‚
‡ “ Furor ”-literally, “ a personified madness.”
