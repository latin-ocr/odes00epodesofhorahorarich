CARM. XXXIII.

Decantes elegos, cur tibi junior
Laesa praeniteat fide.

Insignem tenui fronte Lycorida 96’ζ

Libertina, fretis acrior Hadriae
Curvantis Calabros sinus.

fatal to all frank and noble expression of the human countenance. The
Roman ladies were accustomed to hide their foreheads by a bandage‚
elegantly called “ nimbus ’'—z'.e .‚ the cloud which accompanied the ap-

pearance of the celestials.
