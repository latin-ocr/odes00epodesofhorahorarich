462 THE EponEs oF HORACE.

EPODE XIV.

TO MAECENAS IN EXCUSE FOR INDOLENCE IN COMPLETING
THE VERSES HE HAD PROMISED.

It is impossible to say whether the verses thus promised
and deferred were, as commonly supposed, the collection
composed in this Book of Epodes, or some single iambic
poem. The context seems to favour the latter supposition.

The

Why this soft sloth‚ through inmost sense diffusing
Oblivi'on as complete .

As if with parched lip Ι had drained from Lethe
Whole beakers brimmed with sleep ?—

Thou kill'st me with that question oft-repeated—
Maecenas, truthful man‚⁹⁵

A song I promised thee 5 to keep my promise
A god, a god forbids—

Forbids the iambics, for Ι have begun'them‚
To shape themselves to close.†

Thus it is said, by love inflamed, the Teian
Lost his diviner art :

And on the shell to which he wailed his sorrow,
Music imperfect died.

Thou too art scorched 3 enjoy thy lot 3 no fairer
Flame, shot from Helen's eyes,

Fired Troy z-me Phryne burm—a wench too glowing
To stint her warmth to one.

*i “Candide Maecenas.’' “Candide” here has the signification of
honourable or truthful. You kill me—you, a man of honour—asking
me so often why Ι do not fulfil my promise.
