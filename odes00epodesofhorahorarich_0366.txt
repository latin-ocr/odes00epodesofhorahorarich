ODE XXVIII.
ON THE FEAST-DAY OF NEPTUNE.

It is but a waste of ingenious trifling to conjecture who or
what Lyde was, or, indeed, if any Lyde whatever existed
elsewhere than in the poet's fancy. The poem is very lively
and graceful, and evidently intended for general popularity
as a song, without any personal application to the writer.

What, on the feast-day of Neptune,
Can I do better? Up, Lyde 1 Out from its hiding—place,
uick
Drag focith the Caecuban hoarded 3
Make an attack upon Wisdom! On to the siege of her
fort 1

See how the noon is declining,
Yet, as if day were at stand-still, laggard, thou leav'st in
the store
The cask which has lazily slumbered
Since Bibulus acted as consul 3 now is its time to awake.

Sing we, by turns, of King Neptune,
And the green locks of the N ereids 3 then to thy bow-
shapen lyre
Chant us a hymn to Latona,
And to the swift-footed Dian, and to her arrows of light 3

Then, as the crown of thy verses,
Chant to the goddess who visitS, borne on her car by the
swanS,
Cyclades, Cnidos, and Paphos;
Night, too, shall have her deserts, and lullabies rock her
to sleep.⁹⁵
