238. THE onEs OF HORACE.

ODE VI.
ON THE soCIAL coRRUPTION OF THE TIME.

Macleane observes that, “As the former (five) odes are
addressed more to qualities of young men, this refers more
especially to the vices of young women, and so Horace dis-
charges the promise with which this series of odes begins.’'
To me, on the contrary, it is precisely because of the lines
which so freely describe the vices of young women, single
and married, that I hesitate to class this ode among those
to which the introductory verse of the first ode applies, Let
any man consider if a poet, as the Muse’s priest‚ could have

addressed,

Roman, the sins thy fathers have committed, ,

From thee, though guiltless, shall exact atonement,

Till tottering fanes⁹⁶ and temples be restored,
And smoke-grimed† statues of neglected gods,

Thou rul’st by being to the gods subjected,
To this each deed’s conception and completion
Refer 3 full many an ill the gods contemned
Have showered upon this sorrowing Italy.

Twice have Monaeses‡ and the Parthian riders
Of Pacorus crushed our evil-omened onslaught,
And to their puny torques smiled to add
The spoils of armour stripped from Roman 'breasts.

⁴* The restoration of the temples and sanes decayed by time, or bumed
down in the civil warS, was among the chief reforms of Augustus.—
Suet. ‚ Oct. xxx.

’l‘ “ Smoke-grimed‚’'—partly by conflagrations commemorated by ’

Tacitus and Suetonius, partly by the sumes from the sacrifices. Stated
times for the washing of the statues, with solemn rites, were appointed.
