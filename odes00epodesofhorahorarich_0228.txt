180 THE onEs OF HORACE.

ODE XVI.

To POMPEIUS GROSPHUS.

According to the scholiast in CruquiuS, this Pompeius
Grosphus, a Sicilian by origin, was of the Equestrian order.
Cicero (in Cic. Verr. ΙΙ. iii. 23) speaks of Eubulides Gros-
phus Centuripinus, as a man of eminent worth, noble birth,

and princely wealth. Estre conjectures that this Grosphus was
made

For ease prays he who in the wide AEgaean
Storm-seized, looks up on clouds that heap their darkness
O'er the lost moon, while dim the constellations

Fade from the sailor.

Ease, still for ease, sighs Thracia fierce in battle,
Still for ease sighs the quivered Mede. Ah, Grosphus ἒ
Nor gems nor purple, no, nor gold can buy it 3

Ease is not venal.

Bribed by no king‚⁹⁶ dispersed before no lictor,

Throng the wild tumults of a soul in trouble,

And the cares circling round a sleepless pillow‚
Under ceiled fretwork.†

He lives on little well who, for all splendonr,
Decks his plain board with some prized silver heirloom.‡
From him no greed of gain, of loss no terror,

Snatch the light slumbers.

Why, briefly strong, with space in time thus bounded,
Launch we so many arrows into distance?

⁴* “Non enim gazae.” “ Gazae,'' from a Persian word, means “the
king’s treasury‚'' “the royal coffers.”
ἢ· “ Laqueata tecta,'' “non totius domus sed cubiculorum et tricli-

niarum. '’-DILLENBURGER.
ἶ “ Paternum salinum''——“the paternal or hereditary salt-cellar.''
