434 THE EPoDEs OF HORACE.

EPODE V.

ΟΝ ΤΗΕ WITCH CANIDIA.

None of Horace’s poems excels this in point of power——
and the power herein exhibited is of the highest kind 3 it is
power over the passions of pity and terror. The degree of
humour admitted is just sufficient to heighten the effectos
the more tragic element. The scene is brought before the
eye of the reader with a marvellous distinctness. A boy of
good birth, as is shown by the toga praetexta and bulla which
he wears, has been decoyed or stolen from his home, and
carried at night to some house—probably Canidia's. The
poem opens with his terrified exclamations‚ as Canidia and
her three associate witches stand around him. He is stripped‚
, buried chin-deep in a pit, and tantalised with the sight of
food which he is not permitted to taste, till, thus wasted
away, his liver and marrow may form the crowning ingre·-
dient of the caldron in which the other materials for a philter

have been placed. T hat it is for an old profligate, whom

O'er earth and o’er the human race presideth,†
What means this gathering? why on me alone,

Fixed in fierce stare, those ominous dread faces?
By thine own children, if, indeed, for theess

Lucina brought to light true fleshly children— ·

⁴* “At‚ O deorum,’' ἃς. The word “at,'' thus commencing the
ode, is significant of the commotion and hurry of the speaker, and also
brings the whole scene more vividly before the reader. The poem
begins, as it were, in the middle of the boy’s address to the witches,
omitting what had gone before.
