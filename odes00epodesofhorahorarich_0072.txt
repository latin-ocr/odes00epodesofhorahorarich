24 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE VI.
To M. V1PSAN1Us AGRIPPA.

No public man among the partisans of Augustus is more
remarkable for the union of extraordinary talents with ex—
traordinary fortune than the Vipsanius Agrippa to whom
this ode is addressed. Sprung from a very obscure fam-
ily, he might have failed in obtaining a fair career for his
powers but for the accident of being a fellow-student with
the young Octavius at Apollonia. He thus, at the age of
twenty, became one of the most intimate associates, and
one of the most influential advisers, of the future emperor
of the world. While he was yet in youth he had achieved
the highest distinctions, and secured the most eminent sta-
tion. He had passed through the office of praetor and con-
sul, and established, by a series of brilliant successes, the
fame of a great general. As a naval commander he became
yet more illustriously. distinguished. He constructed the
Roman. navy 3 defeated Sextus Pompeius, then master of the
sea3 commanded the fleet against M. Antony3 and the
victory at Actium was mainly owing to his skill. It was
soon after that last victory that this ode is supposed to
have been written. All the honours Augustus could confer
were heaped on him 3 the emperor united him to his own
family, first by a marriage with his niece Marcella, subse—
quently, yet more closely, by marriage with his daughter
Julia. Fortune never deserted Agrippa to the close of his
life at the age of fifty-one. His character seems to have been a
union of qualities rarely found together,—sagacity of design,

rapidity

’Tis by Varius that Song, borne on pinions Homeric,

Shall exalt thy renown as the valiant and victor,

Whatsoe’er the bold soldier by land or by ocean
With thee for his leader achieved.
