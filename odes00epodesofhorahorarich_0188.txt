140 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE V.

TO GABINIUS.

This poem is designated variously in the MSS. as “Lalage,''
“To the Lover of Lalage,” &c According to one early MS.
(the Zurich), it is inscribed to· Gabinius. But even Estre
cannot tell us who Gabinius was, though Orelli conjectures
him to have been son or grandson to A. Gabinius, Cicero’s
enemy. The poem is of very general application, and the
leading idea is expressed with great elegance and spirit.

Not yet can she bear, with neck supple, the yoke‚
Not yet with another submit to be paired 3
Immature for the duties of mate,
And the fiery embrace of the buss,

Thine heifer confines all her heart to green fields 3
Now pausing to slake summer heats in the stream,
Now with steerlings yet younger at play

Midst the sallows that drip on the shore.

Till ripe, do not long for the fruit of the grape 3
Anon varied Autumn shall deepen its hues,
And empurple the clusters that now
Do but pallidly peep from the leaf:

Anon, 'tis thyself she will seek 3 fervent Time
Speeds on, adding quick to her youth's crowning fiower
Blooming seasons subtracted from thine3
Then shall Lalage glow for a sponse:

And then not so lovely the coy Pholo‘e,
Nor Chloris resplendent with shoulders of snow,
As a moon in the stillness of night
Shining pure on the calm of a sea3
