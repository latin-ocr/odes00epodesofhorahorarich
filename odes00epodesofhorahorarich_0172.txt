124 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XXXVIII.

TO HIS WINE—SERVER.

Boy, I detest the pomp of Persic fashions—
Coronals wreathed with linden rind ⁹⁵ displease me3
Cease to explore each nook for some belated

Rose of the autumn.

Weave with plain myrtle nothing else, I bid thee 3

Thee not, in serving, misbecomes the myrsse,

Me not, in drinking, underneath the trellised
Bowery vine-leave8.†

⁴* “ Philyra‚'' the rind of the lime-tree used in elaborate garlands.
Ἰ· “ Sub arta vite ''-—-“ arta‚” ‘⁶ close‚’' “ embowering ;” as in the
trellised vine-arbours still common in Italy and parts of Germany.
