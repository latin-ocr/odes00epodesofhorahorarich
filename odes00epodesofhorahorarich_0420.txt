372 THE ODEs OF HORACE.

ODE VI.

TO APOLLO.

This ode may be considered the prooemium to the Secular
Hymn, A.U.C. 737, although evidently written after it. As
that hymn celebrates Apollo and Diana, so this ode appro-
priately commences with an invocation to Apollo, whom
Horace invokes (line 27) to defend the dignity of the

Roman

God, in whom Niobe's sad offspring felt

The stern chastiser of the vaunting tongue‚

And Tityos vast, the ravisher‚—and he,
Phthian Achilles,

Almost the victor of high Troy (to thee

Unequal, over other force supreme) 3

Though warring with dread spear the Sea-nymph's son
Shook Dardan towers,

As falls a pine beneath the biting steel‚

Or cypress wrenched by Eurus from its root,

He fell, and wide and far on Trojan dust
Stamped his great image.

The false horse, duping‚ in Minerva's name,

Lost Trojans mirthful at their feast of death,

With choral dances blithe in Priam's hall,
Hid not Achilles,

His prey, alas Ξ he slew with open hand 3

Isis wrath, alas l had given to Argive flames

The harmless infants even within the womb,
Smiting the unborn,

Had not the Father of the gods, subdued
By thee and Venus, with imploring prayer,
