portant of these Epodes has been employed in the version
of a few of the graver odes—viz.‚ the ordinary form of

blank verse converted into a couplet by alternate termina-
tions in a dissyllable and monosyllable.

In the lighter of these first ten Epodes—viz.‚ Ep. vi. x.—I
have thought that the variation of a more easy and rapid

measure was necessary to represent the lively spirit of the
Latin. ·
