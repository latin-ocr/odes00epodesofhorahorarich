26 THE 'ODES OF HORACE.

Themes so lofty we 'slight ones attempt not, Agrippa, ’

Nor the terrible wrath of unyielding Pelides,

Nor the fell house of Pelops, nor seas which UlysseS‚
The double-tongued hero, explored.

While the Muse that presides over lute-strings unwarlike,
And my own sense of shame would forbid me to lessen,
By the inbom defect of a genius unequal,

The glories of Caesar and thee.

Who can worthily sing Mars in adamant tunie,

Or Merion all grim with the dust-cloud of Ilion,

Or Tydides, when, thanks to the favour of Pallas,
He stood forth a match for the gods?

κ We of feasts‚ we of battles, on youths rashly dai-ing
Waged by maids armed with nails too well pared for
much slaughter‚
Sing‚ devoid of love's flame 3 or, if somewhat it scorch us,
Stin wont to make light of the pain.
