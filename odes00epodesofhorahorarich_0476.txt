428 THE EPODES OF HORACE.

Never such heat from pestilentia] comets
Parched dry Apulia, thirsting for a shower 3
Less hot that gift which, through the massive shoulders
Of sturdy Hercules», burned life away.
Jocose Maecenas, 'tis no laughing matter:
If e'er thou try it, may thy sweetheart’s hand
Ward off thy kiss 3 and sacred be her refuge
In the remotest borders of the bed.
