rapidity of action, a brilliant genius in construction, devoted
to practical purposes. When he was forming a fleet he
turned the Lucrine Lake into a harbour for a school to the
mariners by whom he afterwards defeated the tried sailors
of Sextus Pompeius. As aedile his first care was to supply
Rome -with water, restoring the Appian‚ Marcian, and
Anienian aqueducts‚ and building a new one fifteen miles long
from the Tepula to Rome. With this utility of purpose he
combined great magnificence in taste‚ adorning the city with
public buildings and statues by the ablest artists he could find.
All these daring and splendid qualities were accompanied
by a modesty or a prudence which· preserved the affection
of the people and avoided all chance of exciting the jealousy
of Augustus He twice refused a triumph.

'The reader will observe with what ease Horace avoids all
servility in the brief homage he delicately renders to Agrippa,
and the playfulness of the concluding stanza would seem to
intimate a certain familiarity of intercourse, or at all events
that there was nothing in the temper of Agrippa, two years
younger than· himself, so austere as to be shocked by the
poet's favourite subjects for song. Of the poems of Varius,
to whose muse Horace refers the due celebration of Agrippa’s
deeds, only a few fragmentary lines have been preserved.
“ Among these is the description of a hound, which is vigorous
and striking. The fragment has been imitated by Virgfl,
whom he preceded as an epic poet. His tragedy of ‘Thy-
estes’ seems to have survived in repute his epics, since
Quintilian does not mention those, while he accords to
‘Thyestes’ the high praise of saying “that it might have
stood comparison with any of the Greek dramatic master-
pieces.''
