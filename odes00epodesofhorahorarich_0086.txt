38 THE ODEs OF HORACE.

ODE X.

TO MERCURY.

The scholiast Porphyrion says this ode was taken from
Alcaeus, who, he asserts, and Pausanias confirms it, invented f

the story· about Apollo's cows or oxen. The story is cele-
brated

Mercury, thou eloquent grandson of Atlas, l ὼ ww

Who didst the rude manners of earth’s earl races

First mould into form, both by graceful Palaestraj⁶
And by skilled language—

mefAm

Of thee will I sing, togreat Jove and Olympus

L ight herald 3—sing thee of wreathed lute the inventor,

So cunning to hide whatsoe⁷ er the whim took thee
Gaily to pilfer.

When Phoebus in wrath sought to frighten thy childhood

If thou didst not restore the kine tricksomely stolen,

While threatening his shafts he was robbed of his quiver3
Laughed out Apollo ἔ

⁴* No English paraphrase can adequately render Palaestra, which was
especially attributed to the invention of Hermes. It appears to have
been originally distinct from the gymnasia, and appropriated chiefly
to the training of the athletae in wrestling and the Pancratium. When
towards the decline of the Republic the Romans imitated the Greeks in
these and other less manly customs‚ they attached to their villas
places for exercise called indiscriminately Gymnasia or Palaestrae.
The meaning of the stanza is that Mercury taught the early races how to
discipline body by skilled exercise‚ and express thought by cultivated
language ; and I agree with Orelli in construing “voce '² thus, and not
as song or music, which is rather the gift of Apollo.
