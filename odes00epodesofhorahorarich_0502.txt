‘4514 THE EPODE'S oF' “HORACE

v EPODE X.

ON MAEVIUS SETTING OUT ΟΝ Α VOYAGE.

The name of Maevius has become proverbially identified
with the ideal of abad poet3 but, after all, the justice of
this very unpleasant immortality rests upon no satisfactory
evidence. Virgil, with laconic disdain, diSmisses him and
Bavius to obloquy, and this poem is a specimen of Horace’s
mode, in his hot youth, of treating a person to whom he
owed a grudge. 'But poets are very untrustworthy judges of
the merits of a contemporary poet, whom, for some reason
or other, they dislike. If nothing of Southey be left to
remote posterity, and he is only then to be judged by what
Byron has said of him, Southey would appear a sort of
Maevius. On the'· other hand, what would Byron seem if
nothing were left of his works, and, one or two thousand
years hence, he* were to be judged by the opinions of his
verse which Southey and Wordsworth and Coleridge have
left on record? As to the severest things said of Maevius
by writers of a later generation, and who had⁴ probably
never read 3 line of him, they are but echoes of the old
lampoons, “Give a dog a bad name,'' &Q If it be true,
as the commentator in ‘Cruquius sayS, that Maevius was “a
‘detractor of all learned men,’' and a cultivator of archaisms,
‘oran elder school of expression, “sectator vocum antiqua-

rum,''

Under ill· boding auspices puts forth the vessel
› Which has Maevius—a rank· -smelling cargo—on board3
Either side of that vessel, with surges the roughest‚
Ο be mindful,1 pray thee, wild Auster, to scourge. ¹
On· 311 ocean upheaved from its inmost foundations, ,
May the *dark frowning Eurus snap-cables ⁴and bars 3] · > ·
