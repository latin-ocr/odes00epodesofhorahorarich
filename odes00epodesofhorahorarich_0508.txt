460 THE EPODEs OF HORACE.

Broach the cask which was born with myself in the year
Of the Consul T orquatus.* All else be unsaid 3
For, perchance‚ by some turn in our fortunes, a god
May all else to their place in times brighter restore.
Now let nard Achaemenian afford us its balm ;
Doubt and dread let the chords of Cyllene† dispel 3
Listen all to the song which the Centaur renowned
Sang of old to the ears of his great foster-son :—
“ Boy invincible‚ goddess-born, mortal thyself,‡
The domain of Assaracus waits thee afar3
There the petty§ Scamander’s cold streams cut their way,
,ι And there slidingly lapses the smooth Simois.
From that land, by the certain decree of their woof‚
Have the Weavers of Doom broken off thy return,
And thy mother, the blue-eyed, shall never again
Bear thee back o'er the path of her seas to thy home.
But when there, let each burden of evils ordained,
From thy bosom be lifted by wine and by song 3
Soothers they of a converse so sweet, it can charm
All the cares which deform our existence away.'’

⁴* “ Tu vina Torquato,'’ διε. Here he addresses himself to the master
of the feast. Sextus Manlius Torquatus was consul A.U.C. 689, the year
of Horace’s birth—-“ O nata mecum consule Manlio,'' Lib. ΙΙΙ. xxi, 1.

’1- “Fide Cyllenea‚’'—-vi2.‚ the lyre, invented by Mercury‚ born on
Mount Cyllene, in Arcadia. There seems to me much beauty in the
choice of the word, which introduces an image of Arcadian freedom
from care—the ideal holiday life.

‡ Achilles.

ἓ Ritter supposes that the Scamander is here emphatically called
small (parvi Scamandri flumina) antithetically to “grandi alumno ''--
the great hero who found the scene of his actions by a stream so small.
Should this conjecture, exquisitely critical, if not too refined, be ad-
mitted, then “lubricus et Simois '' must form a part, of the antithesis
insinuated3 i. e.‚ actions so great beside a stream so small—actions so
vehement and of renown so loud, beside a stream so smooth.
