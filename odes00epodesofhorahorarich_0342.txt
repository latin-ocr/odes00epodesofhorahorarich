294 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XXIII.

TO PHIDYLE.

Jani and other Commentators have supposed the Phidyle
here addressed to be Horace’s country housekeeper‚ and
that Horace in this ode answers some complaint of hers
that her master did not permit her to sacrifice in a manner
sufficiently handsome. Orelli observes that Phidyle could

not

If with each new-born moon thou lift to Heaven thy suppli-
ant hands,

If with some grains of frankincense, fresh corn, and flesh of
swine‚
My rustic Phidyle, thy rites
Appease thy simple Lares,

Thy fruitful vines shall neither feel the south wind's poisoned
breath,³⁵
Nor mildew blight to sterile dearth thy harvests in the ear,
Nor appled autumn’s sicklied airs
Infect thy tender weanlings.

Let victims whose devoted blood shall tinge the Pontiff’s
axe
Pasture on snow-clad Algidus, mid oak and ilex groveS‚
Or, fattening fast on Alban meadS,
Grow ripe for pompous slaughter :†

But not from thee thy homely gods ask hecatombs of sheep3

Content are they with what thou giv'st--content with rural
crowns ;
