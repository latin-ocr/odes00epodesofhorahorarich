126 THE ODEs OF HORACE.

BOOK II.—ODE Ι.

ΤΟ ASINIUS POLLIO.

Pollio was among Caesar’s generals when he crossed the
Rubicon, and at the battle of Pharsalia. After Caesar’s
death he joined M. Antony‚ and sided with him in the Peru-
sian war. He remained neutral after the battle of Actium.
Indeed he retired from an active share in public life after his
· victorious expedition against the Parthini, an Illyrian people
bordering on Dalmatia, and it is to that victory which
Horace refers as the “ Dalmatian triumph.” He then gave

himself

The civil feuds which from Metellus date,
The causeS‚ errors‚ conduct of the war,
Fortune's capricious sport‚
The fatal friendships of august allies‚

And arms yet crusted with inexpiate blood 3—
Such work is risked upon a perilous die :
Thou tread’st on smouldering fires,
By the false lava heaped on them concealed.

Let for a while the tragic Muse forsake
Her stage, till thou set forth the tale of Rome,
Then the grand gift of song,
With the Cecropian buskin‚ reassume,

Pollio, in forum and in senate famed,
Grief's bold defender‚ counsel’s thoughtful guide,
For whom the laurel‚ won
In fields Dalmatian, blooms forth ever green.
