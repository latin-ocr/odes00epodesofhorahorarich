8 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Exco Rsus.

“ Me doctarum hederae praemia frontium.''

Wolff, Hare, Tate, and some other Commentators, would
substitute “ Te ’' for “ Me ''—applying the line to Maecenas,
“ T lzee the ivy—the prize of learned brows—associates with
gods above 3 Me the cool woods, &c., set apart from the com-
mon crowd.’‘ This reading is rejected by the highest critical
authorities, including Orelli and Macleane 3 but it appears
in itself entitled to more respect than is shown by the latter.
For there is 'some force in the remark, that in referring to
the various tastes and characteristics of ⁴ men, Horace would
scarcely avoid all complimentary reference to Maecenas him-
self 3 and there is yet more force in another remark that, if
Horace says that the ivy wreath associates him with the
higher or celestial godS, there, is a certain bathos, if not con-
tradiction, in immediately afterwards saying that his tastes
associate himaewith the inferior or terrestrial deities—z'. a,
nymphs and Satyrs. It is said in vindication of ‘⁶ Me'' in-
stead of “ Te‚’⁷ that ‘⁶ doctus ” is a word very appropriate to
poets 3 that the ivy, sacred to Bacchus, was the fit and
usual garland for a lyric poet 3 and that Horace could never
stoop to the absurd flattery of insinuating that Maecenas was
a greater poet than himself. But, in answer to all this, it
may be urged that Horace elsewhere especially applies the
word “ doctus '' to Maecenas 3 in Lib. ΙΙΙ. Od. viii. line 4,-

“ Docte sermones utriusque linguae 3''

‘and again, more emphatically, Epist. xix, line 1,—
“Prisco si eredis, Maecenas docte, Cratino.”

And though the ivy was appropriate to poets, it was not
appropriate to poets alone. Horace (Lib. Ι. Epist. iii„
addressed to Julius Florus) speaks of it as the reward of
