.' BOOK III.——ODE VI. 239

addressed, in the original, lines from 21 to 32, not to' freed-
women and singing-girls‚ but to the well-born maidens and
brides of Rome. That the poem was written about the same
time as the others is a reasonable conjecture, and probably
with the same intention of assisting the reforms of Augustus,
among which Horace subsequently celebrates the stricter
laws regulating and affecting marriage. But Ι do not think
the poem was or could be one of those specially addressed
to the young3 and, independently of the lines I have referred
t0, the concluding stanza, in fierce condemnation of them-
selves and their immediate parents, would be very unlike the
skilful way in which Horace “admissus circum praecordia

ludit.''
CARM. VI.

Delicta majorum immeritus lues,
Romane, donec templa³⁵ refeceris,
AEdesque labentes deorum, et

Foeda nigro simulacra fumo.†

s Dis te minorem quod geris, imperas t
Hinc omne principium, huc refer exitum.
Di multa neglecti dederunt
Hesperiae mala luctuosae.

Jam bis Monaesesss et Pacori manus
Non auspicatos contudit impetus
Nostros, et adjecisse praedam
Torquibus exiguis renidet.

Saxa, legate to M. Antony. Four years later, when Pacorus was dead,
the Parthians defeated Antony commanding in person. It is not known
who is meant by Monaeses. Plutarch mentions a Parthian of that name
who fled to Antony, but it nowhere appears that he bore arms against
the Romans. Orelli and Macleane favour the conjecture that by Mon-
aeses is meant Surenas, who defeated Crassus, A.U.C. 701—supposing
Surenas to be merely an Oriental title of dignity‚ and Monaeses to have
been the proper name of Crassus's conqueror.
