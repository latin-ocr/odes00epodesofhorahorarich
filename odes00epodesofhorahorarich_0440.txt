392 ⁴ THE ODES OF HORACE.

As it whirls the smoke cresting the point of its summit
Round and around it*

But that now thou mayst know to what mirth I invite thee,

'Tis in honour of Ides, not ungrateful to Phyllis,

’Tis the day that halves April, sweet month in which Venus
Rose out of ocean3

Day, indeed, that by me should be solemnised duly—

Scarce mine own natal day I hold equally sacred,

Since it is by its light, year on year, my Maecenas
Sums ⁴up life’s riches.

Come, that Telephus whom thou art seeking (poor Phyllis ἒ

He’s a youth above thee)*is now chained to another.

She is wanton and rich, and she holds him in bondage,
Pleased with his fetters.

Phaethon, burnt in his chariot, deters from ambition,
Winged Pegasus spurning Bellerophon earth-born
May admonish thee also by this solemn lesson,

“ Seek but what suits thee 3’'

Deeming Hope, when it flies out of reach, is unlawful,

O set not thy heart where the lots are unequal.

Come, with me be contented, of all loves my latest3
Love with thee endeth.

After thee never more woman’s face shall inflame me,
O, be cheered, then, and come 3 let me teach thee such
measures
As the voice which I love into sweetness shall render 3
Song lessens sorrow.

⁴* “ Sordidum flammae trepidant rotantes
Vertice fumum.'’
“ ‘Vertice ’ is the top of the flame‚ which flickers as it whirls the dark
smoke on its erest—a spiral flame, culminating in a column of smoke.
It seems as if Horace were writing with a fire burning before him, and
caught the idea as he wrote.’'—MACLEANE.
