242 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Not from such parents sprang that race undaunted‚
’ Who reddened ocean with the gore of Carthage‚
Beat down stout Pyrrhus, great Antiochus,
And broke the might of direful Hannibal.

That manly raee was born of warriors rustic,

’ Tutored to cleave with Sabine spades the furrow,

And, at some rigid mother's bluff command,
Shouldering the logs their lusty right hands hewed,

What time the sun reversed the mountain shadows,
And from the yoke released the wearied oxen,

As his own chariot slowly passed away,
Leaving on earth the friendly hour of rest.

What does time dwarf not and deform‚ corrupting 1
Our father's age ignobler than our grandsires' -
Bore us yet more depraved 3 and we in turn
Shall leave a race more vicious than ourselveS.
