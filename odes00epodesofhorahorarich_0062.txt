14 THE* ODES OF HORACE.

Joying in battle-clang and 'glancing helms

And the grim aspect of the horseless Moorff

Fixing his death-scowl on the gory foe,

(Mercury) ; and considering the whole space of time which “this poem

not probable that Horace here applies the word ‘⁶ juvenis” to August-
us in reference to the age in which he first announced himself as “ Caesaris
ultor'’ (Caesar's avenger), and in order to achieve that name and fulfil
that‘ object descended from his celestia] rank as Mercury, or (to define
more clearly the mythical functions of Mercury) as the direct messenger
from Jove to man? Augustus, then, was a youth in every sense of the
word. In fact he was barely twenty when he declared it to be his resolve
and his mission to avenge the death of his uncle. At that age, judging
