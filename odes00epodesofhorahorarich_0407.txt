BOOK 1v.—0DE 1v. 3 59

usually lengthy and involved. It takes four strophes‚ or
sixteen verses, before it disentangles itself of its similes, and
reaches their application. I do not think that it deserves
the blame some critics have attached to it for the slowness
and complication with which the image of the young eagle
is worked out 3 perhaps, indeed, the hesitating efforts of the
bird before it gathers strength to attack dragons are artisti-
cally expressed in the labour of the verse. But I venture
to doubt whether the poem would not have been better
without the second simile of the lion-wh‘elp, which has no
novelty to recommend it, and is very inferior in picturesque
vigour to the first one, while it is less appropriate to the
eulogy on Drusus. The young eagle training itself to grap-
ple with dragons that resist it, conveys an image of force
against force 3 but it is very little honour to a lion-whelp to
conquer a helpless roe-deer or she-goat. “ Caprea '' means
either, but Yonge appears to me right in giving the former
interpretation to the word in this passage. Ritter vindicates
the simile of the lion-whelp, observing that the illustration
of the sheepfold and the dragons would not be appropriate
to the Raeti, and that therefore the poet adds the image by
which they and Drusus are comprehended.

CARM. IV.

Qualem ministrum fulminis alitem,
Cui rex deorum regnum in aves vagas
Permisit, expertus fidelem
Juppiter in Ganymede flavo,

Olim juventas et patrius vigor
Nido laborum propulit inscium :
Vernique, jam nimbis remotis,
Insolitos docuere nisus

Venti paventem : mox in ovilia
Demisit hostem vividus impetus ε
