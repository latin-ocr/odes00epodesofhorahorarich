442 THE EPODES OF HORACE.

But pausing long, now in his last despair,
Launched the full wrath of Thyestean curses.⁹⁵
“ Witchcrafts invert not the great laws divine
Of right and wrong as they invert things human 3 †
So to those laws my dooming curse appeals,
And draws down wrath too dire for expiation.
Mark where thus foully murdered Ι expire‚
With every night Ι haunt you as a Fury, ’ζ
Mangle your cheeks, a ghost with bird-like claws 3
For such the power of those dread gods the Manes.

An incubus, and murder sleep with horror 3
And at the last, as through the streets ye slink‚

Street after street the crowd shall rise against yon,
Hither and thither bounded, till to death
Stoned by fierce mobs, vile hags obscene, ye perish 3

by Lambinus : “ VVitchcraft (venena) can invert the great principle of
wrong and right, but cannot invert the condition or fate (or vicissitude
in the fate) of men‚’' “valent’' being understood in the first clause.
Munro, Introduction, p. xxviii, adopts the arrangement of Lambinus,
with one point of difference. “ Ι do not think‚'' he says, “ ‘ Magnum ’
can be joined with ‘ sas nefasque.’ 1 have therefore made it parenthet-
ical where it seems to me to have much force. The meaning is,
‘ venena (id quod magnum est) fas nefasque valent Convertere, humanam
vicem non valent. ' ’‘ Ritter takes “venena '² as poisons which may be ben-
eficial as medicaments‚ or deadly, used with malignant purposes, and are
thus “magnum fas nefasque ;’' and takes “ humanam vicem'’ as the retri-
bution due to human deeds. Orelli, in an excursus, gives, with his usual
