456 THE EPODES OF HORACE.

And may Aquilo rise in his might as when rending
Upon hill-peaks the holm-oaks that rock to his blast Ξ
On the blackness of night let no friendly star glimmer
Save the baleful Orion, whose setting is storrn 5
Nor the deep know a billow more calm than the breakers
Which o’erwhelmed the victorious armada of Greece,
When, from Ilion consumed, to the vessel of Ajax
Pallas ⁹⁶ turned the wrath due to her temple profaned 1
Ha, what sweat-drops will run from the brows of thy sailors, ’
And how palely thy puddle-blood ooze from thy cheeks 3
As thou call’st out for aid—with that shriek which shames
manhood †—-
On the Jove who disdains such a caitiff to hear3
When thy keel strains and cracks in the deep gulf Ionic‚
Howling back the grim howl of the stormy south-blast.
But O 1 if in some desolate creek thou shalt furnish
To the maw of the sea-gulls a banquet superb, ”
To the Tempests a lamb and lewd goat shall be offered
As a tribute of thanks for deliverance from thee.

³* It is cleverly said by one of the critics‚ that Pallas is appropriately
enough referred to here as the avenger of the bad poetry with which
Maevius had insulted her.

’θ’ “Illa non virilis ejulatio.'’ He speaks as though he heard the
man crying.—MACLEANE.
