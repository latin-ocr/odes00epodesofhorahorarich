158 THE oDEs OF HORACE.

Wean thy heart then at last from these memories too soft,
Let us chant the fresh trophies our Caesar has won,

Linking on, to the nations subdued,
Bleak Niphates'⁶ all ice-locked, the Mede’s haughty
nver,

Now submissively humbling the erest of its waves 3
While the edict of Rome has imprisoned the Scyths,
In the narrow domain of their steppeS‚
And the steed of each rider halts reined at the borders.

⁴* ‘⁴ Rigidum Niphaten,
Medumque flumen.‘’

That Niphates was the name of a mountain-range east of the Tigris is
certain 3 whether there was also a river of that name is much disputed,
though Lucan and Juvenal take it for granted. Possibly the Tigris,
which, according to Strabo, rises on the mountain-range of Niphates,
may be the river here meant. There was a small river called Medus
which flowed into the Araxes, but this was too insignificant sor the
mention Horace makes of the ‘⁶ Medum flumen‚” even if he knew of its
existence3 and most of the later commentators concur in thinking the
river thus designated was the Euphrates.
