. EPODE XIV. · 463

The beauty who inflames Maecenas, so gracefully mentioned
at the close of the poem, is, according to the scholiasts,
certainly Terentia, whom <Maecenas was then either married
to or courting. And that assumption is generally adopted
by modern critics. Still it scarcely seems consistent with
Roman manners, or with Horace’s good breeding and know-
ledge of the world, that he should 'imply a comparison be-
tWeen his passing caprice for a public wanton, and the
honourable love of a man of the highest station to the lady
he had married, or was wooing in marriage.

CARM. XIV.

⁴ 'Mollis inertia cur tantam diffuderit imis μ

Oblivionem sensibus,

Pocula Lethaeos ut si ducentia somnos
Arente fauce traxerim,

Candide Maecenas,³⁶ occidis saepe rogando z
Deus, deus nam me vetat

Inceptos, olim'promissum carmen, iambos
Ad umbilicum adducere.†

Non aliter Samio dicunt arsisse Bathyllo
Anacreonta Teium, ¹

Qui persaepe cava testudine flevit amorem,
Non elaboratum ad pedem. ’

Ureris ipse miser: quod si non pulchrior ignis
Accendit obsessam Ilion,

Gaude sorte tua3 me libertina, neque uno
Contenta, Phryne macerat.
