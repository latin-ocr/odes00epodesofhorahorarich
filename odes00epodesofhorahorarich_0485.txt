EPODE v. 437

Per hoc inane purpurae decus precor,⁹⁵
Per improbaturum haec Jovem,

Quid ut noverca me intueris, aut uti
Petita ferro belua?'

Ut haec trementi questus ore constitit
Insignibus raptis puer,

Impube corpuS‚ quale posset impia
Mollire Thracum pectora 3

Plumamque nocturnae strigis,

Herbasque, quas Iolcos atque Hiberia‡
Mittit venenorum ferax,

Et ossa'ab ore rapta jejunae canis,§
Flammis aduri Colchicis. ΙΙ

Spargens Avernales aquasfll

Hold o’er the dead their carnival,
Gorging and growling o'er carcass and limb‚’‘ &c.

witches are not bumed as fuel in the magie (Colchian) flames, but are
boiled as materials for the philter‚ of which the marrow and liver of the
unhappy child are the completing ingredientS.
