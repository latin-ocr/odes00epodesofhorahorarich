182 THE ODEs OF HORACE.

Why crave new suns Ρ What exile from his country
F lies himself also ?

Diseased Care* ascends the brazen galley‚

And rides amidst the armed men to the battle,†

F leeter than stag, and fleeter than, when driving

The mind, which now is glad, should hate to carry

Its care beyond the Present 3 what is bitter

With easy smile should sweeten ε nought was ever
Happy on all sides.

Untimely death snatched off renowned Achilles ;
Tithonus lived to dwindle into shadow 3
And haply what the Hour to thee refuses

Me it will proffer.‡

Around thine home a hundred flocks are bleati'ng‚

Low the Sicilian heifers‚ neighs the courser

Trained to the race—car 3 woofs in Afric purple
Twice-tinged array thee :

To me the Fate, that cannot err,§ hath given
Some roods of land, some breathings, lowly murmured,
Of Grecian Muse, and power to scorn the malice

Of the mean vulgar.

-ORELLL “ With ‘turmas equitum’ is usually compared ‘ post equi-
tem sedet atra cura,’ but the sense there is a little different. Here he
speaks of care following a man to the field of battle ; there he refers to
the rich man ambling on his horse.”-MAcLEANE.

,ἶ “ Et mihi forsan, tibi quod negarit,
Porriget Hora.''

Ι think, with Orelli, that this simply means, “ Fortune‚ or the Hour,
