106 THE ooEs OF HORACE.

o D E XXXII.
TO HIS LYRE.

This short invocation to his lyre has the air of a prelude
to some meditated poem of greater importance. Several
of the Manuscripts commence “ Poscimus‚’' which reading
Bentley adopts. The modern editors agree in preferring
“Poscimur‚’' which has more of the outburst of song, and
renders the poem more directly an address to the lyre.

We are summoned. If e’er, under shadow sequestered‚
Has sweet dalliance with thee in light moments of leisure

Given birth to a something which lives, and may, haply,
Live in years later,

Rouse thee now, and discourse in the strains of the Roman,
Vocal shell, first attuned by the patriot of Lesbos,

Who, in war though so fieree, yet in battle, or mooring
On the wet sea-saud

His bark, tempest-tossed‚ chaunted Liber, the MuseS,
Smiling Venus, the Boy ever clinging beside her,

And, adorned by dark looks and by eyes of dark lustre,
Beautiful Lycuse

O thou grace of Apollo, O charm in Jove's banquetS‚
Holy shell, dulcet solace of labour and sorrow,

O respond to my greeting, when Ι, with rite solemn,
Duly invoke thee.
