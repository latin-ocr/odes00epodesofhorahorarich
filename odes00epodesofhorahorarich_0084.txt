36 THE onus OF HORACE.

Shun to seek what is hid in the womb of the morrow 3
Count the lot of each day as clear gain in life’s ledger 3
Spurn not thou, who art young, dulcet loves 3
Spurn not, thou, choral dances and song

While the hoar-frost morose keeps aloof from thy verdure.
Thine the sports of the Campus,⁹⁶ the gay public gardens 3
Thine at twilight the words whispered low3
Each in turn has its own happy hour:

And thine the sweet laugh of the girl—which betrays her
Hiding slyly within the dim nook of the threshold‚
And the love-token snatched from the wrist‚
Or the finger’s not obstinate hold.

* ‘ ¹ Campus et areae ”—the Campus Martius, in which, in the forenoon‚
athletic sports were practised, and the public promenades (areae) in dif-
ferent parts of the city, and especially round the temples, which were
the resort of loungers in the afternoon. Orelli thus gracefully elucidates
the concluding verse. “ The scene,” he says, “is this : the lover goes
at the appointed hour to the door of his mistress, which stands ajar; he
calls 'upon her with low whispers : the girl keeps silence, having play·
fully hid herself behind the threshold, until at last she betrays herself by
her laugh. The lover then rushes in, and carries off as a love-pledge her
bracelet or ring, after a struggle on her part not too pertinaciously coy.”
