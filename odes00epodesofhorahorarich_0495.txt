EPoDE VI. 447

date of this ode. This supposition is not tenable, for Cassius
Severus, as Orelli remarks, must have been a boy, or a youth
of about twenty, when the ode was composed 3 nor is there
any authority on record that Cassius Severus was a poet.
Other commentators have supposed the person meant was
Maevius or Bavius. If the right name be Cassius, nothing
is known about him 3 nor is it of any importance. Horace's
invective, for what we know to the contrary, might have
been as unjust and inappropriate as the lampoons of irritable
young poets generally are. Ritter conjectures the person
there satirised to have been Furius Bibaculus, notorious for
the bitterness of his iambics, and who included Octavian
Caesar in his attacks.

CARM. VI.

Quid immerentes hospites vexas, canis,
Ignavus adversum lupos?

Quin huc inanes, si potes, vertis minas,
Et me remorsurum petis ?

Nam, qualis aut Molossus, aut fulvus Lacon,
Amica vis pastoribus,

Agam per altas aure sublata nives,
Quaecunque praecedet fera :

Tu, cum timenda voce complesti nemus,
Projectum odoraris cibum.

Cave, cave : namque in malos asperrimus
Parata tollo cornua 3

Qualis Lycambae spretus infido gener,
Aut acer hostis Bupalof‚Åµ

An, si quis atro dente me petiverit,
Inultus ut flebo puer?
