364 THE oDEs OF HORACE.

Through loss, through wounds, receives
New gain, new life-yea, from the very steel ε

“ Not fiercer did the Hydra hewn, regrow
Against Alcides, chased to be o'ercome 3
Nor dragon-teeth, earth-sown
In Thebes or Colchis, spring to armed rnen 3

“ Merged in the deepS, more fair comes forth its star 2*
Wrestle and win‚ it bears the winner down 3
And widowed wives shall tell
Of victors vanquished on the fields it fought.†

“ No more to Carthage shall I send proud news 3
Dies, dies the power, the fortune, the renown
Of the great Punic name,
Dies hope itself, for Hasdrubal is slain. ‡

“ T here’s nought the hands of men from Claudius sprung
Shall not achieve, with Jove their guardian god,
Through the sharp stress of war
Sped by the providence of heedful cares.'’

 

* “ Evenit.’' Orelli, following Jahn, has “ exiit ''—a reading un·
sanctioned by more recent editors.

’1- “ Proelia conjugibus loquenda.” Orelli considers that the line re·
fers to the Roman wives speaking with exultation. of the wars waged by
their husbands. Ritter, on the other hand, powerfully supports the
interpretation of Mitscherlich—vi2.‚ that the line refers to the widows
of the slain. His argument seems to me convincing.

ἶ Torrentius considers that here ends the speech attributed to Han-
nibal, and that in the last verse Horace speaks in his own person—
an opinion which has had many followers, and is defended by Ritter.
Orelli, supported by Macleane and Yonge, on the other hand, contends
that the speech of Hannibal is continued to the close os the ode—-
firstly, because it is more complimentary to the Neros that their praise
and predicted renown should corne from the mouth of their foe; second-
ly, because it is more poetical to conclude the poem with the prophecy
of Hannibal, and more in the spirit of Pindar‚ as Olymp. 4, and Nem. 4.
Munro gives his authority to this reading.
