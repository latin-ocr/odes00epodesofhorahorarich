222 THE ODES OF HORACE.

A miracle to all who hold their eyrie
In beetling Acherontia‚ or whom forests
Embower in Bantian glens,
Or rich Forentum's lowland glebes enclose,

That, safe from prowling bear and baleful adder—
That, heaped with myrtle and the hallowing laurel,
Calm I should slumber on,
Infant courageous under ward divine.

Yours, yours am Ι, Ο Muses, whether lifted
To Sabine hills—or whether cool Praeneste,
Or Tibur’s sunny slopes‚
Or limpid Baiae⁹⁶ more my steps allure.

The lines arrayed and routed at Philippi,
The accursed tree‚ the rock of PalinuruS‚†
Stormed by Sieilian waves,

Spared me, the lover of your choirs and founts.

Where ye be with me I would go Undaunted 3
Tempt‚ a glad mariner, the madding Euxine 3
Or, a blithe traveller‚ brave
The sands that burn upon Assyrian shores ;

Visit the Briton, terrible to strangers‚
Concanian hordes, drunk with the blood of horses,
And, safe from every harm,

Quivered Geloni and the Scythian stream.

* “ Liquidae Baiae.” The epithet applies either to the salubrity and
purity of the waters, or to the clearness of the air at Baiae.—Schol.
Cruq. Orelli prefers the latter interpretation. “ Limpid’' appears the
best translation of “ 1iquidae‚‘’ being applicable equally .to either air or
water, which “ liquid,” in our sense of the word, would not be.
