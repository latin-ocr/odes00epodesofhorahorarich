EPODE 11. 421 ’

miser is never contented with his own lot, but rather extols
those who follow opposite pursuits :—

‘⁴ Nemo ut avarus
Se probet, ac potius laudet diversa sequentes; ”

but that nevertheless the nature of the man returns to him 3
andis you offered to let him exchange with the person he
envies‚ and so be happy, he would not accept the offer. The
same idea is expressed more briefly, Book Ι. Ode i. lines
15, 3 5—“The merchant, terrified by the storms‚ lauds the
ease of the country, but very soon refits his battered ves-
sels.'' That a rich money-lender might at some moment feel
and express very glowingly an enthusiasm for country life
is natural enough 3 we have instances of that every day. ’ ΝΟ
one praises or covets a country life more than a rich Jew or
contractor. We do not know the occasion which may have
suggested the poem3 but nothing is more likely than that
there was a report that the famous usurer was about to buy
a country place and retire from business 3 and on the strength
of that rumour Horace wrote the poem.

CARM. II.

‘ Beatus ille, qui procul negotiis,
Ut prisca gens mortalium, .

Paterna rura bobus exercet suis,
Solutus omni fenore‚⁹⁶

Neque excitatur classico miles truci,
Neque horret iratum marest·

Forumque vitat et superba civium
Potentiorum limina.

Ergo aut adulta vitium propagine
Altas maritat populos, *s

bonds, and is so employed in the Satires3 and suggests, as a more literal
translation, “ Unshackled by the bonds of usury.”

Τ “ Nec horret iratum mare.” This does not apply to the sailor, but
to the trader or merchant—“ nec mercaturam exercet.’'—ORELL1.
