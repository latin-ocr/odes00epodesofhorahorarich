Venusia (Dillenburger‚ Orelli, Macleane). If so, it is con
jectured that the poem would have been written in earlier
life, when Horace revisited his native spot—perhaps A.U.c.
717—since it is held scarcely probable that he would have
thought of consecrating the fountain in Venusia, when he
was settled in the remote district of his Sabine farm. It
may, however, be likely enough, as Tate contends (Horat.
Restit. p. 88), that Horace transferred the name, endeared
to him by early association, to the spring near his later home.
Yonge suggests the query, “ Was Bandusia the name of the
place, or of the presiding nymph of the fountain?’'—See
Orelli's full and very elegant note on this subject. 1
CARM. XIII.

O fons Bandusiae, splendidior vitro,
Dulci digne mero non sine floribus,
Cras donaberis haedo,
Cui frons turgida cornibus

Primis et venerem et proelia destinat;
Frustra :nam gelidos inficiet tibi
Rubro sanguine rivos
Lascivi suboles gregis.

Te flagrantis atrox hora Caniculae
Nescit tangere ς tu frigus amabile
Fessis vomere tauris
Praebes, et pecori vago.

Fies nobilium tu quoque fontium,
Me dicente cavis impositam ilicem
Saxis‚⁹⁵ unde loquaces
Lymphae desiliunt tuae.
