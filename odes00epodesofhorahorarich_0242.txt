Scaled to the Father's malm, didst hurl again to earth huge
Rhoetus—
F ronting his might with lion-fangs,
And jaws of yawning horror 3

Albeit thou wert deerned a god more fit for choral dances,
For jest and sport the readiest Power, of slenderer use in

Yet peace and war found thee the same,
Of both the soul and centre.

When flashed the golden horn that decks thy front through
Stygian shadOWS‚

Harmless the Hell- -dog wagged his tail to greet thy glorious
coming,

And gently licked with triple tongue
Thine hallowed feet receding.‡
