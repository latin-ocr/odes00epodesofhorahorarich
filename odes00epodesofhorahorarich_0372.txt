324 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Loosed crags, uprooted trees,
And herds and flocks, and the lost homes of men,

While neighbouring forests, and far mountain-peaks

Mingle their roar. Happy* indeed is he,

I praise her seated by ine 3 † if she shake
Her parting wings I give back what she gave,
And, in my virtue wrapped,
Make honest Poverty my dowerless bride.

'Tis not for me, when groans the mast beneath

And bargain with the gods,
Lest gainful bales from Cyprus or from Tyre

Add to the treasures of the greedy deep 3
Then from the wreck my slender boat‡ the gale
And the Twin star shall speed,
Safe with one rower through AEgaean storms.
