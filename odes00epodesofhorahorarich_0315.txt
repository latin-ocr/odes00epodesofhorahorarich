the ode addressing herself. The poem is, perhapS, more or
less imitated from one by Alcaeus, of which only a single
verse is preserved.. The metre of the ode has given much
trouble to Commentators, especially to those who insist upon
the theory that all Horace's odes are reducible to quatrain
stanzas, while this ode is in a stanza of three lines, accord-
ing to the authority of MSS. (with the exception of the
Turinese one). An attempt to remodel it into quatrain will
be found in Orelli’s excursus to the ode, and is adopted by
Yonge in his edition.

CARM. XII.

Miserarum est neque amori dare ludum, neque dulci
Mala vino lavere, aut exanimari metuentes
Patruae verbera linguae*

Tibi qualum Cythereae puer ales, tibi telas Ι
Operosaeque Minervae studium aufert, N eobule,
Liparaei nitor Hebri,

Simul unctos Tiberinis humeros lavit in undis,
Eques ipso melior Bellerophonte, neque pugno
Neque segni pede victus 3

Catus idem per apertum fugientes agitato
Grege cervos jaculari, et celer alto latitantem
Fruticeto excipere aprum.
