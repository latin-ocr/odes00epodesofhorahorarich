CARM. VI I.

O saepe mecum ternpus in ultimum*
Deducte, Bruto militiae duce,
'Quis te redonavit Quiritem
Dis patriis Italoque caelo,

Pompei meorum prime sodalium ?
Cum quo morantem saepe diem mero
Fregi coronatus nitentes
Malobathro Syrio capillos,

Tecum Philippos et celerem fugam
Sensi, relicta non bene parmula 5
Cum fracta virtus, et minaces
Turpe solum tetigere mento.†

Sed me per hostes Mercurius ss celer
Denso paventem sustulit aere ;
Te rursus in bellum resorbens
Unda fretis tulit aestuosis.

probably the last accusation to which a soldier who had shared with
his friend the extre-mest dangers of Brutus would be fairly subjected.
The accusation derived from his own playful reference is confuted by
the lines that immediately follow :—When valour was broken, and
those who had most menaced touched ground with their chins—z‘.e.,
as Orelli construes it, begged for quarter, than which flight itself was
more honourable. In fact, Brutus himself advised flight. We much
prefer this interpretation to that which would make Horace sneer
at those haughty boasters for being slain. Horace was the last man to
sneer at the soldier who fell bravely in battle, while he has specially
singled for contempt the soldier who asks for quarter—(Lib. III. Ode
v. l. 36.)

· ‡ Mercury was the tutelary god of poets, whom, according to astro-
logers, his planet still favours. In C. iii. 4, 26, Horace ascribes his
preservation, not to Mercury, but to the Muses.
