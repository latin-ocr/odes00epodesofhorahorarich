98 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Each head ⁹⁵ must pay to Proserpine the poll-tax.
Me also, Notus,† hurrying on to join

His comrade setting amidst storm, Orion,
Plunged into death amid Illyrian waves.

But thOU, O sailor, churlishly begrudge not

A sand-grain to my graveless bones and skull;
So may whatever the east wind shall threaten

To waves Hesperian, pass thee harmless by

And waste its wrath upon Venusian forests :

So from all-righteous Jove and him who guards
Tarentum’s consecrated haven, Neptune,

Be every profit they can send thee showered.

Think'st thou 'tis nought to doom thy guiltless children
To dread atonement for their father’s wrong ?
Nay, on thyself may fall dire retribution
And the just laws that give back scorn for scorn.

I'll not be left, with prayers disdained, revengeless,
No expiation could atone such crime 3

Whate'er thy haste, this task not long delays thee——
A little dust thrice sprinkled—then away.

⁴⁶ “Nullum saeva caput Proserpina fugit ”—in allusion to the lock
of hair which, according to the popular superstition, Proserpine cut off
from the head xof the dying.

† “Me also, N otus,” &c. If the poem be supposed a dialogue, it
seems to me that this is the place at which the second speaker, as the
ghost of an unburied man, suddenly starts up and interposes.-—See Intro-
duction.
