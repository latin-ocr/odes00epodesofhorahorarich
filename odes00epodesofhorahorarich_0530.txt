482 THE EPoDEs OF HoRACE.

CANIDIA'S REPLY.

“ Why on ears locked against thee pour prayer unavailing?
Not more deas to the sailor, stripped bare to the skin,

Are the rocks upon which, in the depth of the winter,
Breaks in thunder the reef of a merciless sea.

What, forsooth Ξ raise a laugh at the rites of Cotytto⁹⁶
Divulged? Mock the Cupid of Cupids most free?

And the earth shall acknowledge my scorn and my triumph.

Mould and move human life in the wax of an image 3
Who can snatch with my chantings the moon from the
