94 THE ODES OF HORACE.

mean that the want of the scanty gift of a little earth was
keeping him back from his rest, I do not see how the words
will bear that sense 3 nor can I translate ‘ cohibent ' with Dillen-
burger and others as if it was meant that his body occupied

can only mean that he was under the sand, whether partially

supposition, and thinks the subject of the ode is more likely
to have been suggested at Tarentum than elsewhere. He
deems “that the words ‘ Neptuno custode Tarenti’ seem to
fix the scene, and that it does not appear why a person speak-
