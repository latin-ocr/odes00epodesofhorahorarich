62 . THE ODES oF HORACE.

Be appeased then: that vehement heat of the bosom ’
In the sensitive heyday of youth tempted me τοο,
And it whirled me all frantie away
Down the torrent of scurrilous song.

Now I seek to exchange rude emotions for soft oneS‚
Provided my penitence move thee to pardon,
And my full recantation thus made,
O be friendS‚ and restore me thy heart.
