308 · THE oDEs OF HORACE.

O D E XXVI.
To VENUS.

This ode has been generally supposed to be written when
Horace had arrived at a time of life sufficiently advanced to
retire from the service of the ladies, and Malherbe, the
French poet, had it in his eye when, at the age of fifty, he
made farewell visits to the fair ones he had courted till then,

and
Ι have lived till of late well approved by the fair,
And have, not without glory, made war in their cause 3
Now the wall on the left side of Venus>ur shall guard
My arms, and the lute which has done with the service.

Here, here, place the flambeaux which lit the night-march 3
Here, the bows and the crowbars—dread weapons of siege,†
Carrying menace of doom to the insolent gates
Which refused at my conquering approach to sur—
render.

Regal goddess who reignest o’er Cyprus the blest,
And o’er Memphis, unchilled by the snow-flakes of Thrace,
Lift on high o'er that arrogant Chloe thy scourge,
And by one smarting touch fright her into submission.

⁴* In the temple of Venus, on the left wall, as being most propitious.
——MACLEANR The left side, as the heart side, is now, in many super-
stitious practices derived from the ancients, considered the best for div-
inations connected with the affections. In chiromancy, the left hand is
examined in preference to the right, not only for the line of life, but for
the lines supposed to prognosticate in affairs of the heart.

† The torches to light the gallant to the house he went to attack‚ and
the crowbar to burst open her door, are intelligible enough. What is
meant by “ arcu5‚'’ “the bows,” is by no means so clear. The weapon
may be merely symbolical (Cupid’s bow and arrows), or it may have
been the arbalist or cross-bow, and used to frighten the porter.—-See
Orelli's note.
