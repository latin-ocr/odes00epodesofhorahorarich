INTRODUCTION. xliii

obligations to the distinguished scholars who have permitted
me to consult them in the course of this translation. Many
years ago Ι submitted the earliest specimens of my attempts
to my valued friend Dr Kennedy. His encouragement
induced me to pr'oceed⁴ with my undertaking, while his
‚advice and suggestions enabled me materially to improve it.
With no less liberal a kindness another friend, the Rev.
F. W. Farrar, has permitted me to encroach on his time,
and profit by his taste and his learning. Much more could
Ι say in gratitude, as to the services so generously rendered
me by these eminent scholars, were it not for the'fear
that Ι might seem in so doing to shelter my defects
and shortcomings under the authority of their names, It
is enough for me to acknowledge that to them must be
largely ascribed any merit which may be accorded to my
labours, and that without their aid my faults would have
been much more numerous and grave. Ι

Whatever else may be said of the work that I now dis-
miss to its fate, let me hope that it will be at least con-
sidered, by those best competent to judge, a conscientious
and painstaking endeavour to give as faithful an interpreta-
tion of the original as the difference of language will permit.

 

This preliminary Introduction, with slight alterations, and
· a few specimens of the Translation, first appeared in ⁴ Black-
wood's Magazine' for April, May, July, and August 1868.
