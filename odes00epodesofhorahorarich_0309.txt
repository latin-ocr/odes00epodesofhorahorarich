CARM. XI,

Mercuri, nam te docilis magistro

Movit Amphion lapides canendo,

Tuque, Testudo, resonare septem
Callida nervis,

Nec loquax* olim neque grata, nunc et

Divitum mensis et amica templis 3

Dic modos, Lyde quibus obstinatas
Applicet aures z

Quae, velut latis equa trima campis,

Ludit exsultim metuitque Qgi‚

Nuptiarum expers et adhuc protervo
Cruda marito.

ΤιιἹι potes tigres comitesque silvas

Ducere, et rivos celeres morari3

Cessit immanis tibi blandienti
Janitor aulae,

Cerberus, quamvis furiale centum

Muniant angues caput ejus, atque

Spiritus teter saniesque manet
Ore trilingui.

to the power of song and music, as exercised by Orpheus.
