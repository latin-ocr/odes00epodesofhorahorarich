BOOK III.--ODE Ι. 201

surrounding the priests and singing the praises of the godS‚
has also, according to the scholiasts, a much wider signi-

“ Horace‚'’ says Macleane5 “speaks as if he despaired of
impressing his precepts on any but the young, and bids the
rest stand aside, as incapable of being initiated in the true
wisdom of life.” It is not easy to assign an appropriate
heading to this ode. T hat which I select appears, on the
whole, better than any other in use, though not quite satis-
factory. > The whole ode, which ranks high among the
· noblest attempts of a poet to embody didactic purpose in
lyrical formffconsists in a succession of brilliant images or
pictures, seemingly detached, but constituting a moral
whole. 1st, The solemn recognition of the supreme God
triumphant over brute force (“ Clari Giganteo triumpho'⁷),
and governing the universe 3 2dly, The impartiality of Fate,
and the certainty of death 3 3dly, The misery of the guilty
conscience not to be soothed by sensual or artistic enJ‘oy-
ments. At line 25, “Desiderantem quod satis est,” the
main object of the poem—viz„ in the inculcation of that
wisdom of contentment by which Horace contrives to unite
Epicurean with Stoic philosophy—develops itself, and is
continued to the close.
