104 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XXXI.
PRAYER To APOLLO.

After the battle of Actium, AugustUS‚ in commencing the
task of social reformet, restored the ancient temples and
built new oneS. Amongst the latter, A. U. C. 726, he dedicated
to Apollo a temple, with a library attached to it, on the
Palatine. This charming poem expresses the poet's private
supplication to the god thus newly installed.

What demands at Apollo's new temple the poet?
For what prays he outpouring new wine in libation?
Not fertile Sardinia's rich sheaves,
Not sunny Calabria’s fair herds 3

N either prays he for gold, nor the 1vory of Indus,
Nor the meadows whose margin the calm· -flowing Liris
Eats into with murmurless wave.
Let those on whom F ortune bestows

So luxurious a grape, prune the vine-trees of Cales,
And let trade's wealthy magnate exchange for the vintage
Spiced cargoes of Syria, and drain
Cups ⁹⁶ sculptured for pontiffs in gold 3

Dear, indeed, to the gods must be he who revisits
Twice and thrice every year the Atlantic, unpunished ε
To me for a feast, mallows light,
And endives and olives suffice.

Give me health in myself to enjoy the things granted,
Ο thou son of Latona3 sound mind in sound body 3
Keep mine age free from all that degrades,

And let it not fail of the lyre.

⁴* ‘⁴ Culullis,'’ sculptured eups used by the pontiffs and Vestal virgins
in the sacred festivals.‘
