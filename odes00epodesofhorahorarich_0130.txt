82 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XXIII.

To CHLofi.

This ode has the appearance of being imitated, though
but slightly, from a fragment in Anacreon preserved in
‘ Athenaeus,' ix. p. 396. But it is not the less an illustration
of the native grace with which Horace invests his more
trivial compositions.

Like a fawn dost thou fly from me, Chlo'e',
Like a fawn that, astray on the hill-tops‚
Her shy mother misses and seeks,
Vaguely scared by the breeze and the forest.

Sighs the coming of spring through the leaflets?
Slips the green lizard stirring a bramble?
Her knees knock together with sear,
And her heart beats aloud in its tremor.

Nay, but not as a merciless tiger,
Or an African lion I chase thee 3
Ah! cling to a mother no more,
When thy girlhood is ripe for a lover.
