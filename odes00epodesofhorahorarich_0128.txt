80 THE ODEs OF HORACE.

Sunless side of the world, which the grim air oppresses,
Mist-clad and icc-bound ;

Place rne lone where the earth is denied to man's dwelling,

All so near to its breast glows the car of the day-god 3

And I still should love Lalage—her the sweet-smiling,
Her the sweet-talkingfi'*

⁴* “ Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo,
Dulce loquentem.”

If I might have allowed myself to expand the literal words of the
original into what seems to me the sense implied by the poet, I should
have proposed to translate the lines thus 2-

“ I still should love Lalage—see her, sweet smiling ;
Hear lter, sweet talking.”

For Ι take it that Horace does not merely mean that he would still
love Lalage ‘⁶ sweetly smiling’' and “ sweetly talking ''—an assurance
which seems in itself to belong to a school of poetry vulgarly called
namby-pamby—but rather that, however solitary‚ still, and lifeless be
the place to which he might be transported, he would still be so true to
her image, that in the solitude he would see her sweetly smiling, and
amidst the silence hear her sweetly talking. So Constance, in Shake-
speare, says:-

“ Grief fills the room up os my absent child,
Lies in her bed, walks up and down with me,

Puts on ker pretty looks, repeats her words-‚³³
