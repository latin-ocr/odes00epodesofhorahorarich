xxviii THE onEs OF HORACE.

epithet, inadmissible in prose, but to an illustration at once
very noble and yet very‘ simple 3 and, in rapidity of force, in
the development and completion of the idea, so akin to
oratory, that an impassioned speaker who had his audience
in his hands might have uttered the substance of it in prose.

I may perhaps enable the general reader to comprehend
more clearly what Ι mean by Horace's art in diction, as
starting from the conversational tone, and, save on rare oc-
casions, avoiding a style antagonistic to prose, by a reference
to the two loveliest‚ most elaborate, and most perfect lyrics
in our own language—‘L'Allegro’ and ‘Il Penseroso.' In
these odes Milton takes for representation the two types of
temperament under which mankind are more or less divisibly
ranged—viz., the cheerful and the pensive. But he treats
these two common varieties of all our race as a poet, of a
singularly unique temperament himself, addressing that com-

language is throughout essentially distinct from prose3 it is
like most of his youthful poems, the very quintessence of
poetic fancy, both in imagery and expression. Perfectly
truthful in itself, the poetry in these masterpieces is still not
of that kind of truthfulness which comes home to all men’s
business and bosoms. Like his own soul, it is “a star, and
dwells apart.'' It may be doubted whether Horace, in his
very finest odes, ever, in his maturest age, wrote anything so
exquisitely poetical, regarded as pure poetry addressed to

But then the difference between them and Horace's Odes
is, that out of England the former are little known—certainly
, not appreciated.* Their beauty of form is so delicate, that

read than English. True 3 but that does not prevent those English poets
who address themselves to a cosmopolitan audience, as Shakespeare,
