ODE IX.

TO THALIARCHUS.

Thaliarchus signifies in Greek “arbiter bibendi ”-com-

Labouring forests no longer can bear up' their burden 3

More and rnore bringing bounteously out, Thaliarchus‚
The good wine that has mellowed four years
In the great Sabine two—handled jar.

Leave the rest to the gods, who can strike into quiet
Angry winds in their war with the turbulent waters,
Till the cypress stand calm in the sky—
Till there stir not a leaf on the ash.
