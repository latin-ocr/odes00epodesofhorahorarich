216 THE ODEs OF HORACE.

But now the vile guest of the Spartan adult'ress
Glitters forth nevermore 3-—the forsworn race of Priam
By the aid of its Hector, no more
Breaks in fragments the force of the Greek 3

Sunk to rest is the war so prolonged by our discords,
Ever heneeforth to Mars I give up my resentment,
And my grudge to the grandson⁹⁵ who springs
From the womb of a priestess of Troy.

I admit him to enter the luminous dwellings 3
I admit him to sip† of the juices of nectar,
And, enrolled in the order serene
Of the godS, to partake of their calm.

While between Rome and Ilion there rage the wide ocean,
May the exiles be blest wheresoe'er their dominion ;
So long as the wild herd shall range,
And the wild beast shall litter her cubs

Undisturbed, ’mid the barrows of Priam and Paris,
May the Capitol stand, brightening earth with its glory‚
And dauntless Rome issue her laws
To the Mede she subdues by her arms.

Wide and far may the awe of her name be extended
To the uttermost shores, where the girdle of ocean
Doth from Africa Europe divide,
And where Nile floods the lands with >his swell.

Be she stronger in leaving disdainfully buried
In the caverns of earth the gold—better so hidden,

⁴* Romulus being Juno’s grandson, born of Mars her son, and Ilia
the Trojan priestess.

† “Ducere nectaris succos.” “Ducere,'' i.e., “sorbillere‚” to sip.
