Horace was even acquainted with him at that times *There
must have been some other reason for this reticence, and
it is quite as likely to have been one of artistic taste as one
founded on -personal or political considerations 3 for HOrace
does not mention by name Cleopatra, nor even Sextus
Pompeius. It is consistent with the dignity of lyric song
to avoid the direct mention of the name of our national
enemy, especially if conquered. In. an English lyrical
poem on the Crimean war, we should scarcely think· it

strange if the poet did not obtrude on us the name of
Nicholas.

CARM. IX.

Quando repostum Caecubum ad festas dapes,
Victore laetus Caesare,
Tecum sub alta, sic Jovi gratum, domo,
’ Beate Maecena&⁶ bibam,
Sonante mixtum tibiis carmen lyra,
Hac Dorium, illis barbarum?
Ut nuper, actus cum freto Neptunius ·
Duxl· fugit, ustis navibUS‚
Minatus Urbi vincla, quae detraxerat
’ Servis amicus perfidis.
Romanus, ΞΣ eheu, posteri negabitis,
Emancipatus feminae,
-Fert vallum§ et arma miles, et spadonibus
Servire rugosis potest,

 

the Son of Neptune. Though Horace speaks of the rejoicing at the
defeat of Sextus Pompeius as if it were of late (“ ut nuper''), it occurred
'between five and six years before (A.U.C. 718). Fugitive slaves formed
a large part of the force of Sextus Pompeius.

ss This does not refer to Mark Antony himself, but to the' Roman
soldiers under him. The singular number 15 used poetically.

ξ· ‘Fert vallum. ’' The Roman soldier carried palisades (⁴ ‘vallum’ ⁹)
for an empaled camp. , , ,
