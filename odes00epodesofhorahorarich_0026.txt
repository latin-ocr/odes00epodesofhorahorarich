xxii THE ODEs OF HORACE.

secrets of Horace’s art in lyrical poetry—and which I ven-
ture humbly to think it would be well for modern lyrists to
study—is his temen-ess. Terseness is one of the surest
proofs of painstaking. Nothing was ever more truthful in
art than the well-known reply of the writer to the friendly
critic, who said, ‘⁴ You are too prolix :'’ ‘⁴ Ι had not time to

be shorter.’'
We know from Horace himself that he bestowed upon

his artist-work an artist’s labour-“ Operosa carmina fingo.''
He seems to have so meditated upon the subject > he
chooses as to be able to grasp it readily. There is no wan-
dering after ideas—no seeking to prolong and over-adorn
the main purpose for which he writes. If it be but a votive
inscription to Diana, in which he dedicates a tree to her,
he does not let his command of language carry him beyond
the simple idea he desires to express. He seems always to
consider that he is addressing a very civilised and a very im-
patient audience, which has other occupations in life besides
that of reading verses, and nothing in him is more remarkable
than his study not to be tedious. Perhaps, indeed, itis to
this desire that some of his shortcomings up to the mark
which very poetical critics would assign to lyrical rapture are
to be ascribed 3 but it is a fault on the right side.

The next and much more important characteristic of ,
Horace as a lyrical artist is commonly exhibited in his
grander odes, and often in his lighter ones 3 and to this Ι
do not know if I can give a more expressive word than
picturesqueness. His imagination, in his Odes, predomin-
ates over all his other qualities, great as those other quali-
ties are 3 and that which he images being clear to himself,
'he contrives in very few words to render it distinct and
vivid to the reader. When Lydia is entreated not to spoil
Sybaris 3 by enumerating the very sports for which her lover
has lost taste, he brings before us the whole picture of an
athletic young Roman noble—his achievements in horse-
