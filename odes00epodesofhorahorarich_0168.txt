120 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XXXVII.
ON THE FALL OF CLEOPATRA.

In this ode Horace conspicuously manifests his unri-
valled art of combining terseness and completeness. The
animated rapidity with which the images succeed each
other does not render them less distinct. The three pic-
tures of Cleopatra constitute the action of a drama, her
insolent power with its Oriental surroundings,—her flight
and fall,—her undaunted death. And while, with his in-
herent manliness of sentiment, Horace compels admiration

for

Drink, companions, the moment has come for carousal,
And the foot 1s now free to strike earth 1n brisk measures,
For Salian⁹⁵ feasts now may be decked
The couches of statues divine.

Not before was it lawful from time-honoured cellars
To draw forth into light the stored Caecuban juices, ·
While ruin and death were prepared
For Rome, by the fell madding Queen,

With her horde of vile eunuchs and outcasts polluted,
F ooled by hope, drunk with sweets in the chalice of Fortune':
Soon sobered when slunk from the flames
That enveloped her navies——one ship 1

 

 

⁸* The Salii were the priests of Mars Gradivus, twelve in number.
Their habitual festival was in March, when they paraded the city in
their official robes, carrying with them the twelve sacred shields of Mars,
which they struck with rods, keeping time to the stroke by song and
dance. At the conclusion of the festival the Salii partook of ,a banquet,
proverbial for its magnificeme, in the temple of Mars. “ Pulvinaria '’
are the couches on which the statues were placed, as if the gods them·
selves were banqueters.
