282 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XVIII.

TO FAUNUS.

Faunus was not a stationary divinity. He was supposed
to come in the spring, and depart after the celebration of
his festival in December. From “parvis alumnis'' (trans-
lated “young weanlings''), we may suppose this ode was
written in spring. — MACLEANE. Ritter denies that by
“parvis alumnis'' young animals are meant ; and contends
that the words refer to young plants, transferred from the
nursery to fields or orchards. Ritter also dissents from
the general interpretation, which I have followed, that
“Veneris sodali '' is to be coupled with “ craterae.'' Accord-
ing to him, the companion of Venus is Faunus, the lover of
the Nymphs, and not the wine-bowl.

Faunus, thou lover of coy nymphs who fly thee,
Enter my bounds‚ and fields that slope to sunlight 3
Enter thern gently 3 and depart, propitious

To my young weanlings,

If tender kid, when the year roundS, be offered 3

If to the bowl, Venus's boon companion,

Fail not libation due 1³⁵—With ample incense
Steams thine old altar,

Loose strays the herd on grassy meads disporting,
What time December’ s N ones bring back thy feast— day3
Blithe, o’ er the fields, streams forth the idling hamlet,

“ · F reed-W1th its oxen.

Fearless the lambs behold the wolf prowl near them 3

The woodland strews its leaves before thy footstep 5

And on his hard task-mistress Earth, exulting,
Thrice stamps the delver Η

⁴* ‘⁴ Si tener pleno cadit haedus anno,
Larga nec desunt Veneris sodali
Vina craterae. Vetus ara multo
Fumat odore,” &c.
