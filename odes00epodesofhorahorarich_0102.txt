54 THE ODES OF HORACE.

O ship, shall new waves drift thee back into ocean?
What wouldst thou ? Make fast, O, make fast for the haven 1

deities niched in the stem were indeed gone 3 the cry for Republican
liberty or Senatorial rights was hushed in the graves of Brutus and
Cassius. Assuming with Acron and Buttmann that by the Pontio pine
is symbolised Pompey, whose chief successes were achieved in Pontus
as the conqueror of Mithridates, his name and race were indeed idly
vaunted by Sextus. Recruits distrusted the colours painted on the
