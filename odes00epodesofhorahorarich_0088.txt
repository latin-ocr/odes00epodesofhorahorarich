40 THE ODES OF HORACE.

So t00, led by thee, Priam bearing his treasures

From Ilion, eluded the vaunting Αἐτίἶὲέῗὲξἴε

The watchlights of Thessaly and the remorseless
T ents of the Argive. ,

Thou placest pure souls in the calm of blest dWCUingSLM
With golden staff shepherding gfflffihffigwc3
To gods, whether throned in Olympus or HadeS,

Equally welcome.

 

³* “Quin et Atridas.'' Here Horace abruptly elevates the astute-
ness of Mercury from the playful thefts of infancy to the wise caution ,
with which he leads the innocent and helpless through the severest
dangers; and then naturally, and with all his inimitable terseness, the
poet represents him as condueting no less safely the souls of the dead.
Throughout all those stanzas, from the theft of oxen, when Mercury
was an infant in his cradle, to his crowning mission as the conductor
of souls departed, the same ruling idea of stealtlz is preserved and dei-
fied. Mercury steals the kine from Apollo, he steals Priam through the
Grecian camp, he steals souls through the passage between earth and
Hades‚-—all with a union of guarded secrecy and imperturbable serenity
which, throughout the more playful attributes of Hermes, imply the gran-
deur and inspire the awe that characterise a supernatura] being. No
deity can be more exclusively Greek in this* combination of open joy-
ousness and mystic power. It was a type of divinity as impossible to be
conceived by the Latins as by the Germanic and Scandinavian races,
though they all worshipped a Mercurius.
