INTRODUCTION. xvii

the types of mind formed by a polished metropolis, Horace
preserves, in a degree unknown to those who, like Pope and
Boileau, resemble him more or less on the town-bred side of
his character, the SQLDAQ which makes
him the favourite companion of those whom cool woodlands,
peopled with the beings of fable, “set apart from the crowd.”
He might be as familiar with Sir Philip Sidney in the shades
of Penshurst, as with Lord Chesterfield in the saloons of
Mayfair. And out of this rare combination of practical
wisdom and poetical sentiment there grows that noblest part
of his moral teaching wh1ch is distinct from schools and
sects, and touches at times upon chords more spiritual than
those who do not look below the surface would readily
detect. Hence, in spite of his occasional sins, he has
always found indulgent favour with the clergy of every
Church. Among the dozen books which form the library of
the village cures of France, Horace is sure to be one 3 and
the greatest dignitaries of our own Church are among his
most sedulous critics and his warmest panegyrists.· With all
his melancholy conceptions of the shadow-land beyond the
grave, and the half-sportive, half-pathetic injunction, there·-
fore, to make the most of the passing hour, there lies deep
within his heart a consciousness of nobler truths‚ which
ever and anon finds impressive utterance‚ suggesting pre-
cepts and hinting consolations that elude the rod of Mercury,
and do not accompany the dark flock to the shores of Styx :

“ Virtus recludens immeritis mori
Coelum negata tentat iter via.”
